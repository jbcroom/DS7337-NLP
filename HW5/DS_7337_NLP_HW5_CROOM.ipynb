    "### Assignment Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tCompile a list of static links (permalinks) to individual user movie reviews from one particular website. This will be your working dataset for this assignment, as well as for assignments 7 and 8, which together will make up your semester project.   \n",
    "* it does not matter if you use a crawler or if you manually collect the links, but you will need at least 100 movie review links. Note that, as of this writing, the robots.txt file of IMDB.com allows the crawling of user reviews.\n",
    "* Each link should be to a web page that has only one user review of only one movie, e.g., the user review permalinks on the IMDB site.\n",
    "* Choose reviews of movies that are all in the same genre, e.g., sci-fi, mystery, romance, superhero, etc.  \n",
    "* Make sure your collection includes reviews of several movies in your chosen genre and that it includes a mix of negative and positive reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tExtract noun phrase (NP) chunks from your reviews using the following procedure:\n",
    "* In Python, use BeautifulSoup to grab the main review text from each link.  \n",
    "* Next run each review text through a tokenizer, and then try to NP-chunk it with a shallow parser. \n",
    "* You probably will have too many unknown words, owing to proper names of characters, actors, and so on that are not in your working dictionary. Make sure the main names that are relevant to the movies in your collection of reviews are added to the working lexicon, and then run the NP chunker again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tOutput all the chunks in a single list for each review, and submit that output for this assignment. Also submit a brief written summary of what you did (describe your selection of genre, your source of reviews, how many you collected, and by what means).\n"

You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no ten...   \n3  My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.\\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievem...   \n4              I came to this movie with an open mind, despite the hoo ha around it. Stylistically yep, I can see the hoo haa. The same goes for the acting, once again exceptional . The humour was also done really well. It's just that past the halfway mark it becomes a bit 'meh'. Kind of similar in a way to the film 'us', once it did it's core 'reveal'. It's good that western audiences will watch it and hopefully realise there is a film industry outside of the west..but this film just an ok for me   \n\n  sentiment  \n0  negative  \n1  positive  \n2  negative  \n3  positive  \n4  negative  ",

You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no ten...   \n3  My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.\\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievem...   \n4              I came to this movie with an open mind, despite the hoo ha around it. Stylistically yep, I can see the hoo haa. The same goes for the acting, once again exceptional . The humour was also done really well. It's just that past the halfway mark it becomes a bit 'meh'. Kind of similar in a way to the film 'us', once it did it's core 'reveal'. It's good that western audiences will watch it and hopefully realise there is a film industry outside of the west..but this film just an ok for me   \n\n  sentiment  \\\n0  negative   \n1  positive

    "* The movie selection was based off of movies in the thriller genre. This genere provided a good selection of reviews and movies.\n",
    "* For each of the movies we gathered a positive and negative review based on the users provided rating value. From this we were able to pull 500 total reviews to analyze.\n",

    "* For the most part both parsers captured NP records reasonably well\n",
    "* Both parsers had issues where users did not correctly break sentences. We see some instances of periods not being followed by spaces which caused the parsers to collapse words. It may have been beneficial to look at a pre processing step that ensured more correctly formed sentences.\n",
    "* The more strict parser did remove determinates from the parsing trees. This may or may not be a good thing depending upon future use cases. In general for this exercise it did not have a large impact on the understandability"
