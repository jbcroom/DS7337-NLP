0,The Dark Knight,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4392977/,"First I'd controversially like to point out that this movie wouldn't have gotten as much hype as it did if it wasn't for Heath Ledger's death before the release and the Academy not being afraid to give an Oscar to a corpse.Nevertheless, his performance is easily the best one in the superhero genre and the crafty, well put together New York accent confirms he put a lot of dedication and effort into his methodical role and deserved what he got (an Oscar). This isn't just another Batman movie anymore. Yes, there is action, explosions and stunt work but between that is masterfully crafted dialogue that dwells deep.Batman is his definitive self now, we finally see the fullest of his character and Christian Bale does him justice. Christopher Nolan praised be created complex characters and given each one justifiable treatment. That's the reason the cast works, everyone holds their own, there are no lazily written or neglected characters.With beautiful cinematography and presentation of Gotham, the visuals and the endeavours cast The Dark Knight is a film that easily gets on top of every superhero list and is certainly one to remember... remember for a long time.Final Grade: 9/10",negative,"[['this movie', 'much hype', 'Heath Ledger', 'death', 'the release', 'Academy', 'Oscar', 'a corpse.Nevertheless', 'performance', 'one', 'the superhero', 'genre', 'the crafty', 'New York', 'accent', 'a lot', 'dedication', 'effort', 'methodical role', 'an Oscar'], ['Batman', 'movie'], ['action', 'stunt', 'work', 'dialogue', 'deep.Batman', 'definitive self', 'character', 'Bale', 'justice'], ['Christopher Nolan', 'justifiable treatment'], ['the reason', 'the cast', 'everyone', 'characters.With beautiful cinematography', 'presentation', 'Gotham', 'Dark Knight', 'a film', 'top', 'every superhero', 'list', 'a long time.Final Grade']]","[['movie', 'much hype', 'Heath Ledger', 'death', 'release', 'Academy', 'Oscar', 'corpse.Nevertheless', 'performance', 'one', 'superhero genre', 'crafty', 'New York accent', 'lot of dedication', 'effort', 'methodical role', 'Oscar'], ['Batman movie'], ['action', 'explosions', 'stunt work', 'dialogue', 'deep.Batman', 'definitive self', 'character', 'Christian Bale', 'justice'], ['Christopher Nolan', 'complex characters', 'justifiable treatment'], ['reason', 'cast', 'everyone', 'characters.With beautiful cinematography', 'presentation of Gotham', 'visuals', 'endeavours', 'Dark Knight', 'film', 'top', 'superhero list', 'long time.Final Grade']]"

2,Inception,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2286063/,"I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance.",negative,"[['an impressive trailer', 'an uninteresting film', 'good film'], ['a sci-fi conundrum', 'good sound'], ['important part', 'the film'], ['no plot', 'character', 'soul', 'this film'], ['a beautiful building', 'no paint', 'decoration', 'the inside.It', 'an empty shell', 'a film'], ['no tension'], ['a corporation', 'another corporation', 'the human race.When', 'a dream', 'environment', 'nothing'], [], ['the way', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'scene', 'an inch'], [], ['Watch', 'learn', 'Matrix', 'the camera', 'a couple', 'watch', 'a good film'], ['anyone', 'right mind', 'pointless'], ['A film', 'the soul'], ['anyone', 'anyone', 'show', 'the way', 'an idea', 'US.I', 'the end', 'scene', 'the fact', 'father', 'Paris', 'US', 'every dream', 'sequence', 'the end', 'nothing', 'stake', 'anyone', 'a pointless movie'], ['Nolan', 'praise'], [], ['nothing', 'no substance']]","[['impressive trailer', 'uninteresting film', 'elements', 'good film'], ['great special effects', 'sci-fi conundrum', 'beautiful visuals', 'good sound'], ['important part', 'film'], ['plot', 'character or soul', 'film'], ['beautiful building', 'paint or decoration', 'inside.It', 'empty shell', 'film'], ['tension', 'characters'], ['corporation', 'corporation', 'human race.When', 'dream environment', 'nothing'], ['explosions', 'actions sequences'], ['way', 'Hollywood', 'action scene', 'inch', 'characters'], ['many films'], ['Watch and learn', 'Matrix', 'camera', 'couple of feet', 'half hours', 'watch', 'miles', 'good film'], ['anyone', 'right mind', 'pointless'], ['film', 'soul', 'characters'], ['anyone', 'anyone on show', 'way', 'idea', 'children', 'minutes', 'US.I', 'end scene', 'fact', 'father', 'Paris', 'US', 'children', 'dream sequence', 'means', 'end', 'nothing at stake', 'anyone', 'pointless movie'], ['Nolan', 'praise', 'movies'], [], ['nothing', 'substance']]"
3,Inception,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4692192/,"My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.
For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:
Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular ""Nolan's spirit"" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.
SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - ""extractors"" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of steeling, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called ""inception"". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels ""dream within a dream"", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.
Some short lines about the cast:
Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.",positive,"[['time', 'this movie'], ['mind', 'every moment'], ['someone', 'dream', 'Christopher Nolan', 'every single characteristic',

5,Parasite,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5195256/,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.",positive,"[['a review', 'attempt', 'the movie', 'the film', 'the reason', 'the second half', 'it.It', 'the message', 'a movie', ""'good"", 'win', 'get', 'the end'], ['Hollywood', 'portrayal'], ['Parasite', 'a character', ""a clearer 'moral center""], ['no surprise', 'the message', 'this film', 'the audiences.Some', 'Ki-Taek', 'motive', 'Mr. Park'], ['the meaning', 'expression', 'the dialogue', 'the line', '.It', 'ambiguous phrase', 'privacy', 'position', 'a different position'], ['the latter meaning', 'another image', 'the subject matter', 'the metaphor', 'lighthearted drama', 'the movie', 'likable family', 'snobbish family', 'a comical manner'], ['the movie', 'genuine', 'Bong Joon-Ho', 'a path', 'a director', 'a danger.Instead', 'Mr. Park', 'a reasonable enough character', 'true nature'], ['Ki-Taek', 'the line', 'Ki-Taek', 'private life.At', 'Ki-Taek', 'family', 'Mr. Park', 'house', 'mingle'], ['Ki-Taek', 'Mr. Park', 'family', 'premature', 'admiration', 'the table', 'Mr. Park', 'him.Ki-Taek', 'final disillusionment', 'Mr. Park', 'the smell', 'the dead basement', 'dweller', 'concern', 'son', 'shock', 'Ki-Taek', 'daughter', 'status', 'the ground', 'blood', 'the stab', 'moment', 'Ki-Taek', 'Mr. Park', 'whole family', 'an equal human', 'something', 'insignificant.And', ""the 'line"", 'courtesy', 'proper social behaviour'], ['a line', 'the life', ""'lesser"", 'the passing', 'mental shock', ""'proper"", 'human beings.However', 'Ki-Taek', 'family', 'Mr. Park', 'house', 'Mr. Park', 'family', 'existence', ""'parasite"", 'the presence', 'the hidden basement', 'room', 'the house.With', 'such disillusionment', 'anger', 'Ki-Taek', 'Mr. Park', 'a parasite', 'host', 'a parasite', 'the dead host', 'body', 'the whole', 'the carcass', 'nourishment', 'offsprings.The', 'tragedy', 'something', 'any exceptional defect', 'vice', 'Mr. Park', 'Ki-Taek'], [""a 'line"", 'an invisible hand', 'humanity'], ['the message', 'this film', 'course', 'every movie', 'a commentary', 'society', 'a care-free pastime', 'everyone', 'the movie', 'gear', 'the second half', 'light', 'a serious inherent problem', 'society', 'another heist', 'wrong type', 'comedy', 'candidate', 'film', 'the year']]","[['review', 'attempt', 'movie', 'film', 'reason', 'half of it.It', 'message', 'movie', ""'good guys"", 'win', 'guys', 'get', 'end'], ['Hollywood films', 'portrayal', 'moral values'], ['Parasite', 'movies that people', 'character', ""clearer 'moral center"", 'audiences'], ['surprise', 'message', 'film', 'audiences.Some', 'Ki-Taek', 'motive', 'Mr. Park'], ['meaning', 'expression', 'dialogue', 'line', '.It', 'ambiguous phrase', 'other people', 'privacy', 'position', 'affairs', 'different position'], ['latter meaning', 'image', 'subject matter', 'metaphor', 'families', 'respective dwellings.It', 'such audiences', 'lighthearted drama', 'movie', 'likable family', 'snobbish family', 'comical manner'], ['movie', 'genuine charms', 'Bong Joon-Ho', 'path', 'director', 'danger.Instead', 'Mr. Park', 'reasonable enough character', 'occasional hints', 'true nature'], ['Ki-Taek', 'line', 'Ki-Taek attempts', 'private life.At', 'Ki-Taek', 'other members', 'family', 'Mr. Park', 'house', 'various roles and mingle'], ['Ki-Taek', 'Mr. Park', 'family', 'premature admiration', 'table', 'Mr. Park', 'different species', 'him.Ki-Taek', 'final disillusionment', 'Mr. Park', 'smell', 'basement dweller', 'concern', 'son', 'shock', 'Ki-Taek', 'daughter', 'status', 'ground', 'blood', 'stab', 'moment', 'Ki-Taek', 'Mr. Park', 'whole family', 'equal human', 'something', 'insignificant.And', ""'line"", 'families', 'courtesy', 'proper social behaviour'], ['line', 'life', ""'lesser"", 'human beings', 'passing', 'unpleasant feelings', 'mental shock', ""'proper"", 'human beings.However', 'Ki-Taek', 'family', 'Mr. Park', 'house', 'Mr. Park', 'family', 'existence', ""'parasite"", 'presence', 'basement room', 'house.With', 'such disillusionment and anger', 'Ki-Taek', 'Mr. Park', 'parasite', 'host', 'parasite', 'dead host', 'body', 'whole', 'carcass', 'nourishment', 'offsprings.The tragedy', 'something', 'exceptional defect or vice', 'Mr. Park', 'Ki-Taek', 'personalities'], [""'line"", 'invisible hand', 'classes', 'respective social conditions', 'families', 'humanity', 'manners'], ['message', 'film', 'course', 'movie', 'commentary on society', 'pastime that everyone', 'movie', 'gear', 'second half', 'light', 'serious inherent problem', 'society', 'heist', 'type comedy', 'candidate', 'film', 'year']]"

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

8,Se7en,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0370671/,"`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man.  With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him.  However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise.  Yes it wasn't a great film  but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created.  Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!Se7en was his major break through  where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold.  The story doesn't sound like much  mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless  the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller.  But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out.  From the start we are entombed in mood  the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc.  The we begin to find murders  but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest  Genius!What you don't see is more gory than what you do.  Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets betterright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen.  I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset  so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc.  But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer.  Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans  he spends a lot of it looking beaten up.  Paltrow is OK with what she has  but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles.  R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters.  He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly.  In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word.  However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller  but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's.",negative,"[['retirement', 'Detective Somerset', 'Detective Mills', 'a murder', 'a series'], ['Somerset', 'the killer', 'classic literature', 'Mills', 'anything', 'a crazy man'], ['the killer', 'work', 'Mills', 'Somerset'], ['nothing', 'a dark depressing city', 'moral degradation', 'apathy.When', 'David Fincher', 'the scene', 'debut', 'feature', 'Alien3', 'the world', 'a film', 'Alien', 'franchise'], ['a great film', '\x96', 'the sense', 'mood', 'the dark', 'the tension', 'Fincher'], ['Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'Game', 'Fincher', 'Se7en', 'major break', '\x96', 'dark', 'box-office gold'], ['The story', '\x96', 'retirement', 'a serial killer', 'a series', 'Lethal Weapon', 'thriller'], ['unbelievable .it', 'a story'], ['the start', 'mood', 'the city'], ['Fincher', 'the aftermath', 'the rest', '\x96', 'Genius'], ['the tension', 'pitch', 'the race', 'the killer'], ['the killer', 'the film'], ['the cinema', 'shell', 'shocked.Freeman', 'Somerset \x96', 'a role', 'etc'], ['the perfect foil', 'Mills', 'the killer'], ['Brad Pitt', 'superb ....', 'a film', 'little opportunity', 'a lot'], ['Paltrow', 'a film'], ['R.

9,Se7en,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0370669/,"The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.Score 10/10",positive,"[['The movie', 'Se7en', 'Brad Pitt', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'recent history'], ['The film', 'a well', 'together combination', 'dark visual style', 'intense plot', 'development', 'acting', 'Hollywood', 'clichés'], ['Se7en', 'suspense dramas', 'the need', 'the audience', 'the initial vision', 'the director', 'David Fincher.The', 'story', 'the hunt', 'a serial killer', 'Dante Alighieri', 'Divine Comedy', 'preach', 'man', 'impurity', 'own underlining'], ['Se7en', 'a typical cat', 'mouse', 'detective story', 'a sort', 'modern-myth', 'centre stage'], ['The story'], ['important aspect', 'Se7en', 'the audience', 'story', 'bland', 'the end'], ['the audience', 'the dark', 'the film'], ['Se7en', 'the tide', 'point', 'the audience', 'the gloomy', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'the audience'], ['the film', 'conclusion', 'the audience', 'much apart', 'the film', 'Se7en', 'surprise', 'a single clue'], ['Se7en', 'a lot', 'the movie', 'the grain'], ['A rarity', 'David Fincher', 'Andrew Kevin Walker', 'Se7en'], ['Se7en', 'critical acclaim', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Se7en', 'any film']]","[['movie', 'Se7en', 'Brad Pitt', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'cerebral films', 'recent history'], ['film', 'well', 'combination', 'dark visual style', 'plot development', 'acting', 'outwards', 'unimportant issues', 'Hollywood clichés'], ['Se7en', 'suspense dramas', 'need', 'audience', 'events', 'initial vision', 'director', 'David Fincher.The story', 'hunt', 'serial killer', 'Dante Alighieri', 'deadly sins', 'Divine Comedy', 'preach', 'man', 'impurity', 'victims', 'underlining sins'], ['Se7en', 'typical cat and mouse', 'detective story', 'sort of modern-myth', 'centre stage'], ['story', 'counts', 'levels'], ['aspect of Se7en', 'audience', 'numerous steps', 'story', 'other thrillers', 'bland', 'end'], ['audience', 'dark', 'film'], ['Se7en', 'tide', 'point', 'audience', 'gloomy', 'fear and uncertainty', 'audience', 'characters'], ['film', 'conclusion', 'audience', 'much apart', 'film', 'characters', 'Se7en', 'surprise', 'single clue'], ['Se7en', 'lot', 'people', 'movie', 'grain'], ['rarity with films', 'David Fincher', 'Andrew Kevin Walker', 'Se7en', 'films'], ['Se7en', 'critical acclaim', 'films as Silence', 'Lambs', 'Se7en', 'film']]"
10,The Silence of the Lambs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1204949/,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website .

11,The Silence of the Lambs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0299483/,"Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.

14,The Prestige,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493095/,"What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's ""Memento."" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision.",negative,"[['Prestige', 'a period', 'show', 'business', 'history', 'the turn', 'the century', 'competition'], ['life', 'apparatus', 'Victorian legerdemain'], ['the film', 'the lead'], ['an easy step', 'such unwavering determination', 'deadly territory', 'Rupert Angier', 'a riveting', 'performance', 'Hugh Jackman', 'Alfred Borden', 'Bale', 'Brit', 'each seek', 'revenge', 'the other.The story', 'a novel', 'a perfect fit', 'director', 'Nolan', 'a back-and-forth tug', 'the style', 'Nolan', 'Memento'], ['the game', 'the film', 'a fascinating study', 'single-mindedness.The work', 'sweep'], ['The only odd note', 'casting', 'David Bowie', 'Nikola Tesla', 'nothing', 'Tesla', 'these sort', 'appearance', 'attention', 'superstar', 'Mr. Bowie'], ['Michael Caine', 'dignity', 'depth', 'the old master', 'Scarlett Johanssen', 'the lovely stage', 'assistant', 'the third point', 'a twisted love', 'triangle', 'Andy Serkis', 'Gollum'], ['role.The introduction', 'Tesla', 'another twist', 'the film', 'real-but-possible stage', 'illusion', 'steam-punkish sci-fi'], ['This transition', 'a hard note', 'the beginning', 'the film', 'a direction', 'Nolan', 'the journey', 'dramatic exploration', 'entertaining movie', 'dark ride', 'a theater', 'grand scope', 'vision']]","[['Prestige', 'period of show business history', 'turn', 'century', 'competition between magicians'], ['workings', 'complicated illusions', 'life', 'apparatus', 'actual mechanics', 'Victorian legerdemain'], ['film rings', 'all-consuming obsessions', 'lead characters', 'others'], ['easy step', 'such unwavering determination', 'deadly territory', 'rival magicians', 'Rupert Angier', 'riveting performance', 'Hugh Jackman', 'Alfred Borden', 'Christian Bale', 'lower-class Brit', 'seek', 'revenge', 'other.The story', 'novel', 'feels', 'fit for director Nolan', 'sensibilities', 'machinations', 'men', 'tug of wits', 'style of Nolan', 'Memento'], ['game', 'film', 'fascinating study', 'single-mindedness.The work', 'sweep'], ['note in casting', 'David Bowie', 'Nikola Tesla', 'nothing', 'actual Tesla', 'sort of things', 'appearance', 'attention', 'superstar', 'Mr. Bowie'], ['Solid performances', 'Michael Caine', 'dignity and depth', 'old master', 'Scarlett Johanssen', 'stage assistant', 'third point', 'love triangle', 'Andy Serkis', 'Gollum'], ['introduction of Tesla', 'twist', 'film shifts', 'stage illusion', 'steam-punkish sci-fi'], ['transition', 'hard note', 'beginning', 'film', 'direction', 'Nolan', 'journey', 'fantastic realms', 'narrative rewards', 'dramatic exploration', 'issues', 'entertaining movie', 'dark ride', 'theater', 'grand scope and vision']]"
15,The Prestige,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4183972/,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent.

Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an ""epic,"" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time.

21,Léon: The Professional,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342948/,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting.

22,Psycho,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072163/,"Perfect films are few and far between and the filmmakers usually have no inkling as to the top-notch quality of work they are doing.  Alfred Hitchcock thought it was a good idea to make a new kind of suspense picture back in 1959.  Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order, but bigger bumps must have been the goal.  Hitch had to use his TV crew (from his network series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents..."" because many film executives didn't like the material.  Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented.  At the time, PSYCHO was a nasty-spirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers.  It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless rip-offs.PSYCHO is perfect because: 1) It is in black and white, not blazing technicolor which would have stained the film for no purpose and made the shower murder less artistic. (Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.)2)The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting.  (Hitch made strict stipulations for theatre owners not to allow people into the movie once the picture started in order for this secret to stay secret.)3)Lesser known actors are used to provide a more authentic feel for the characters.  This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins, not exactly a Cary Grant, who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused son/mental madman. (Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)4) The shower scene, of course.  Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the ""old house on the hill"" and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it.  (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror.  (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly.  (Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together, none better than this.)Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time?  I don't think so.  Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.RATING: 10+",negative,"[['no inkling', 'the top-notch quality', 'work'], ['Alfred Hitchcock', 'a good idea', 'a new kind', 'suspense', 'picture'], ['the audience', 'order', 'the goal'], ['Hitch', 'TV', 'crew', 'network', 'series', 'Alfred Hitchcock', 'many film', 'the material'], ['Brit', 'a cinematic milestone', 'the way', 'material'], ['the time', 'PSYCHO', 'a nasty-spirited movie'], ['countless rip-offs.PSYCHO', 'technicolor', 'the film', 'no purpose', 'the shower', 'murder'], ['Hitch', 'the route', 'director', 'Michael Powell', 'an outcast', 'technicolor', 'murder', 'flick', 'PEEPING TOM'], ['The featured star', 'the way', 'a new method', 'casting'], ['Hitch', 'theatre', 'the movie', 'the picture', 'order'], ['Lesser', 'authentic feel'], ['the case', 'Anthony Perkins', 'Cary Grant', 'chaotic portrayal', 'an abused son/mental madman'], ['Hitch', 'Norman Bates', 'distorted state', 'mind', 'evil grin'], ['scene', 'course'], ['any film', 'any kind', 'man', 'such frightening butchery', 'frank brutality'], ['Hitch', 'place', 'minute', 'segment'], ['Norman Bates', 'mother', 'old house', 'the hill', 'part'], ['Hitch', 'a mystery', 'end', 'Vera Miles', 'shot turn', 'a chair'], ['payoff', 'a device', 'this kind', 'psychological terror'], ['Hitch', 'the viewer', 'the staple', 'importance', 'plot', 'the horror', 'no significance'], ['Bernard Hermann', 'famed musical score', 'a pulsating', 'vibrant piece', 'gothic composition', 'the story', 'character'], ['Hitch', 'Hermann', 'none'], ['any other question', 'PSYCHO', 'all time'], [], ['film', 'history', 'a slow course', 'independence', 'honesty', 'PSYCHO', 'everyone', 'this kind', 'film']]","[['Perfect films', 'filmmakers', 'inkling', 'quality of work'], ['Alfred Hitchcock', 'good idea', 'kind of suspense picture'], ['audience', 'bumps', 'order', 'bumps', 'goal'], ['Hitch', 'TV crew', 'network series', 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents', 'film executives', 'material'], ['big Brit', 'cinematic milestone', 'way films', 'material'], ['time', 'PSYCHO', 'nasty-spirited movie', 'moviegoers', 'showers'], ['countless rip-offs.PSYCHO', 'technicolor', 'film', 'purpose', 'shower murder'], ['Hitch', 'route of director Michael Powell', 'outcast', 'technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM'], ['featured star', 'way', 'new method', 'casting'], ['Hitch', 'stipulations for theatre owners', 'people', 'movie', 'picture', 'order'], ['Lesser', 'actors', 'authentic feel', 'characters'], ['case of Anthony Perkins', 'Cary Grant', 'chaotic portrayal', 'abused son/mental madman'], ['Hitch', 'angles', 'shadowy atmospheres', 'Norman Bates', 'state of mind', 'evil grin'], ['scene', 'course'], ['film', 'kind', 'man', 'people', 'such frightening butchery', 'frank brutality'], ['Hitch', 'cuts', 'place', 'minute segment'], ['Norman Bates', 'mother', 'upstairs', 'old house', 'hill', 'watches', 'part'], ['Hitch', 'mystery', 'end', 'Vera Miles', 'shot turn', 'chair'], ['payoff', 'dollars', 'device', 'thrillers', 'kind', 'psychological terror'], ['Hitch', 'viewer', 'staple of importance', 'plot', 'horror', 'significance'], ['Bernard Hermann', 'famed musical score', 'pulsating', 'vibrant piece', 'gothic composition', 'story', 'character actions'], ['Hitch and Hermann', 'several films', 'none'], ['question that PSYCHO', 'films', 'time'], [], ['film history', 'course towards', 'independence', 'honesty after PSYCHO', 'everyone', 'kind of film']]"

25,The Lives of Others,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1379708/,"Because this movie deals with recent German history, some German comments about it get sidetracked into minute historical discussions. Forget them; Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie that should be seen everywhere.The former East Germany, a relatively small country of 16 million people, was controlled by the most sophisticated, cunning, and thorough secret police the world has ever seen, the East German Ministerium für Staatsicherheit, or ""Stasi."" The Stasi had about 90,000 employees -- a staggering number for such a small population -- but even more importantly, recruited a network of hundreds of thousands of ""unofficial employees,"" who submitted secret reports on their co-workers, bosses, friends, neighbors, and even family members. Some did so voluntarily, but many were bribed or blackmailed into collaboration.Das Leben der Anderen, (""The Life of Others"") German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut, builds this painful legacy into a fascinating, moving film. In its moral seriousness, artistic refinement, and depth, Das Leben der Anderen simply towers over other recent German movies, and urgently deserves a wide international release. The fulcrum of the movie (but probably not its most important character) is Georg Dreyman, an up-and-coming East German playwright in his late 30s. Played by the square-jawed Sebastian Koch, Dreyman is an (apparently) convinced socialist who's made his peace with the regime. His plays are either ideologically neutral or acceptable, and he's even received State honors.Although he is a collaborator, he is also a Mensch. He uses his ideological ""cleanliness"" to intervene on behalf of dissidents such as his journalist friend Paul Hauser (Hans-Uwe Bauer). These unfortunates must contend with every humiliation a totalitarian state can invent: their apartments are bugged, friends and family are recruited to inform on them, and chances to publish or perform can be extinguished by one stray comment from a Central Committee member. The most recalcitrant can be kicked out of the country and stripped of their citizenship, like the singer songwriter Wolf Biermann.Dreyman lives in a shabby-genteel, book-filled apartment with his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a renowned actress who often appears in his plays. At the beginning of the movie, Dreyman himself comes under the regime's suspicion, for reasons that become clear only later. The fearful machinery of the Stasi rumbles to life: his movements are recorded, and his apartment bugged. The Stasi had bugging down to a science: a team of meticulously-trained agents swoop into your apartment when you're not there, install miniscule, undetectable listening devices in every single room -- including the bathroom -- and vanish in less than an hour, leaving no trace. Agents set up an secret electronic command post nearby, keeping a written record of every joke, argument, or lovemaking session.The ""operative process"" against Dreyman is overseen by Stasi captain Gerd Wiesler, played by Ulrich Mühe, an actor from the former East who was himself once in the Stasi's cross-hairs. Captain Wiesler starts the film as a colorless, icy, tight-lipped professional who shows no mercy in fighting the ""enemies of socialism"": if he needs to interrogate a suspect for 10 hours without sleep to get a confession, he will do so -- and then place the seat-cover the suspect sat on in a vacuum jar in case the miscreant should later need to be tracked by bloodhounds. At night, Captain Wiesler returns to his tiny apartment in an grubby, anonymous high-rise. He settles himself among his inexpressibly drab furniture, eats a meal squeezed out of a plastic tube while watching reports about agricultural production, and then goes to bed alone.As Captain Wiesler listens to Dreyman and his girlfriend he begins to like them, or perhaps envy the richness and depth of their lives in comparison with his own. Perhaps he also begins to wonder why a stranger should have the right to become privy to Dreyman's most intimate secrets: his occasional impotence, his girlfriend's infidelities, his artistic crises. At the same time, though, Wiesler is under pressure: a Central Committee official has made it clear to Wiesler and his toadying supervisor Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), that Dreyman has to go down. I won't discuss more plot details, as there are unexpected twists. Each of the main characters is drawn deeper into the conflict between Dreyman and the State, and each is torqued by loyalty conflicts that intensify as the pressure increases. The cast is outstanding. Sebastian Koch finds the right combination of poetic detachment and watchful sophistication for Dreyman. Martina Gedeck, as his girlfriend, has the most challenging role, since she's buffeted from all sides: by her suspicious partner, by Stasi agents trying to turn her, and by a lecherous Culture Minister. Ulrich Mühe plays the Stasi agent's transformation with reserve, only hinting at the stages in his character's secret, but decisive, change of heart.Director von Donnersmarck, a blue-blooded West German, has re-created the gray, drained look of the former East, and the nature of Stasi intimidation, with a fidelity that has earned the praise of East Germans. His pacing is relaxed, but doesn't drag; although there are a few longueurs, most scenes unfold at just the right pace, and there are several great set-pieces. One is a bone-rattling episode in the Stasi canteen in which a young recruit is caught telling a joke about East German premier Erich Honecker. Another is the penultimate scene, a masterstroke in which Dreyman gains access to his massive Stasi file, while reading it, suddenly understands episodes of his own life which had never made sense to him before. The ending is perfectly judged; bittersweet and moving without swelling strings or teary confessions.Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie, probably a great one. If it's not picked up for international distribution, it will be a bitter loss for thousands of potential moviegoers in other countries.",positive,"[['this movie', 'recent German history'], ['Forget',

26,Oldboy,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0939842/,"Old Boy sucks! No, wait, let me rephrase that: Old Boy is a stylistically challenging, highly innovative, but ultimately hollow and repugnant exercise in genre film-making. And just to let you know where I'm coming from  'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' was brilliant; an unforgiving and touching descent into doom. In that movie everything that happened somehow had to. One action triggered the next one and we experienced a vicious circle of violence and revenge. The characters seemed trapped in their situation.In Old Boy our protagonist is also trapped, but you know the story, so I won't tell you again. So he's in this room and there is great sound design and camera work. But once he frees himself, the complications and problems multiply. The plot is at first close to incomprehensible as he stumbles from one situation to another. When the villain explains his schemes at the end and brings enlightenment, I just couldn't care anymore. The intriguing premise is destroyed by the revelation that it's all a contrived revenge plot by the bad guy.And contrived it is. The story only works by inserting endless flashbacks (full of bad pathos) and explanations. To keep the audience interested, we get gruesome scenes of murder, self-mutilation and general mayhem. As others have remarked, these scenes are well done, but serve no greater purpose. It's all a so-what comic extravaganza.Out of 'Old Boy' I got small pleasures and a lot of disappointment, courtesy of one of the most interesting directors working today.

27,Oldboy,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1783091/,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance. I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema.

28,Memento,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1532595/,"9) And that's when we realize we could never be sure of anything to begin with.8) When Leonard eventually thinks he has found his wife's killer, eleventh-hour reveals shock us with the possibility that his whole crisis may be nothing more than delusion.7) Editing this movie must have been like navigating inside Las Vegas hotels with no watch or compass: sex and drug distractions, deprivation of day or night, no signposts or exit signs, and of course, nauseous on cheap shrimp and hairy tequila. Untold credit to editor, Dody Dorn, for shuffling the deck as confusingly as possible, yet weaving the tale as tightly as a sanitarium wicker basket.6) But every few minutes, the movie twists back on itself, each flashback a segment of Leonard's life that happened just before the segment we have just seen  and with each flashback, we realize just how wrong Leonard is about who his friends are, his past life, clues to the killer, his quest *in toto.* By about the fourth paragraph we realize: this piece is running backwards.5) From Jonathan Nolan's short story, *Memento Mori*, we meet Leonard mid-investigation, slumming it in a cockroach motel, having lost his job as insurance consultant, looking disheveled (as Guy Pierce can do so natchelly), and optimistically on the trail of the murderer; hanging with gregarious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), and involved with hot bod, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), both of whom seem to be aiding Leonard catch his killer.4) Leonard's last ""new memory"" was the murder of his wife. During the scuffle with his wife's killer, a blow to the head caused his memory faculty to shut down. Whether this is truly biologically possible (if you cannot make new memories, how do you even shop for food and water or pay the rent?), for the movie's purposes, it means Leonard must piece together clues to his wife's killer through copious notes, tattoos on his own body and Polaroids. But the truth will forever elude him and the clues that lead to the killer are mere wraiths, the products of his own ""selective"" reasoning.3) The harder you strive for something, the harder it is to grasp. But what you care least about - or that you were never striving for  falls into your lap. Some call this the path of least resistance, but it's actually called The Reverse Genius Principle. And Leonard - all ephemeral ideas and misplaced action  is a Reverse Genius in full throttle.2) Guy Pearce is the memory-challenged Leonard, who is trying so hard to move forward  to find his wife's killer, but unable to create ""new memories"" to retain info - that he ends up moving backward. Thusly, writer-director Christopher Nolan has crafted a film where the clues to a murder fall neatly OUT of place. Backwards.1) *Memento* opens with a killing. We don't know why.

29,Memento,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0664878/,"Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.

30,Witness for the Prosecution,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1211424/,"This is one of the best ""trial movies"" ever made. It's an outstanding film that is just as good today as it was almost 50 years ago when it was released in the theaters. The shocking ending caused quite a stir back then, too.The only part of the movie I thought looked dated and unrealistic was Tyrone Power's character being able to interrupt the trial with outbursts and not be reprimanded for it. There is no way that would be tolerated, at least today.Otherwise, it's a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain: Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton, who plays Power's defense attorney, grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power's wife. Laughton's dialog is terrific throughout, bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He's just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn't have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester, playing Laughton's nurse. She, too, demonstrates her comedic talent and significantly adds to the fun of watching this film.If you like some fine drama, storyline twists, a little humor thrown in and great acting and dialog, this is a classic film to check out.",negative,"[['trial'], ['an outstanding film', 'good today'], ['a stir', 'only part', 'the movie', 'Tyrone Power', 'character', 'the trial'], ['no way', 'today.Otherwise', 'solid film', 'a good cast', 'fascinating', 'Charles Laughton', 'Marlene Dietrich'], ['Laughton', 'Power', 'defense', 'attorney', 'the spotlight', 'the story', 'Dietrich', 'the movie', 'role', 'Power', 'wife'], ['Laughton', 'dialog', 'a number', 'this serious film'], ['a joy'], ['Dietrich', 'the same amount', 'screen time', 'Laughton.Not', 'Elsa Lanchester', 'Laughton', 'nurse'], ['comedic talent', 'the fun', 'this film.If', 'some fine drama', 'a little humor', 'great acting', 'dialog', 'a classic film']]","[['trial movies'], ['outstanding film', 'good today', 'years', 'theaters'], ['stir', 'only part', 'movie', 'Tyrone Power', 'character', 'trial with outbursts'], ['way', 'today.Otherwise', 'solid film', 'good cast', 'fascinating characters', 'actors', 'Charles Laughton', 'Marlene Dietrich'], ['Laughton', 'Power', 'defense attorney', 'spotlight', 'story but Dietrich', 'movie', 'role as Power', 'wife'], ['Laughton', 'dialog', 'number of laughs', 'serious film'], ['joy'], ['Dietrich', 'same amount', 'time as Laughton.Not', 'Elsa Lanchester', 'Laughton', 'nurse'], ['comedic talent', 'fun', 'film.If', 'fine drama', 'storyline twists', 'little humor', 'great acting and dialog', 'classic film']]"

32,Rear Window,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3181083/,"Alfred Hitchcock awesome intrigue/comedy in which a magazine photographer seeks diversion in watching his neighbors , often with a telephoto lens and binoculars , discovering a possible murder . Thrilling flick with funny moments , nice acting , adequate settings and funny dialogue . The tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses . It involves a bewildered as well as hapless wheelchair bound photographer (James Stewart) because of a broken leg who spies on his neighbours from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder his spouse and dismembered the body . The photographer soon enlists the help of his high society fashion-consultant sweetheart named Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly), his visiting nurse called Stella (Thelma Ritter) and a Detective (Wendell Corey) to investigate the weird deeds .This agreeable and often hilarious picture from master of suspense has a memorable scene after another and was one of the main Alfred Hitchcock films made for Paramount . In fact , at the time the set was the largest indoor set built at Paramount Studios . The entire picture was shot on one set, which required months of planning and construction . The film was shot quickly on the heels of Dial M for murder (1954), November 27 1953-February 26 1954 . Alfred Hitchcock's movies have become famous for a number of elements and special iconography : vertiginous height , blonde bombshells , voyeurism , long non-dialogue sequences , a matter of mistaken identity etc . This charming as well as inventive mystery movie has these particularities ; furthermore contains a fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The first part of this production is slow and artificial ; however , the rest of this suspense picture takes off at high speed . Interesting and intriguing screenplay adapted by John Michael Hayes based on a story by Cornell Woolrich . Screenwriter John Michael Hayes based Lisa on his own wife, who'd been a professional fashion model when they married . The original story by Cornell Woolrich had no love story and no additional neighbors for L.B. Jeffries to spy on, and those elements were created by Alfred Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks and he also was known for making his actors follow the script to the word, and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an engaging as well as fun script . Very good acting by the great James Stewart as as a photographer who soon becomes convinced that one neighbor has killed his wife and Grace Kelly as gorgeous and elegant girlfriend , both of them make a marvelous duo . Grace Kelly made three of her eleven films with Hitchcock; this film, as well as Catch to a thief (1955) and Dial M for murder (1954), but Rear window film was thought of as the best . Excellent support cast such as Thelma Ritter , Wendell Corey , Kathryn Grant , Frank Cady and Raymond Burr . And of course , Hitch cameo , about a half hour into the film, winding the clock in the songwriter's apartment. Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Vistavision by Robert Burks , Alfred's ordinary cameraman , showing nice images from studio . The film negative was considerably damaged as a result of color dye fading as early as the 1960s , nearly all of the yellow image dyes had faded out. Despite fears that the film had been irrevocably damaged, preservation experts were able to restore the film nearly to its original coloration . Rousing as well as atmospheric score by the classic composer Franz Waxman .The motion picture was stunningly directed by maestro of thriller Alfred Hitchcock . The film was unavailable for decades because its rights were bought back by Alfred Hitchcock and left as part of his legacy to his daughter. They've been known for long as the infamous ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"" among film buffs, and were re-released in theatres around 1984 after a 30-year absence. The others are The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), The rope (1948), trouble with Harry (1955), and Vértigo (1958). This essential and fundamental Hitchcock will keep fascinated and thrilling right up until the edge-of-your-seat climax . And the American Film Institute ranked this as the #48 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked #3 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Mystery"" in June

2. Is the police officer so dumb that he gets into Tabu's house even as the neighbour Disa watches on? Which secret lover does that and that too someone who is a senior police officer?
3. A famous yesteryear actor has been murdered. The film runs for a period of at least a couple of weeks after the murder. Hasn't anyone seen the CCTV cameras to confirm if Pramod Sinha even left the building like Tabu claims?
4. Akash sees Tabu pushing neighbour Disa but the CCTV cameras in the lift, in which Akash is, can't catch this. Right?

35,Andhadhun,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4526401/,"Many have reviewed Andhadhun and rated it highly and I am no different. I found it pretty damn entertaining myself. Following is just a review of the ending and how enriching that experience was for me as an audience. Hope you all like it.Watched Adhadhun again today. I never made a post about its ending the first time because I liked the Director's version of the open ending and leaving it up to the audience's interpretation.However, when I watched it again today, I realized that the film does not have any open ending if you carefully observe it.Before I go into the meaning of the ending we have to understand the phenomena of Rabbit or Duck illusion. Google ""Rabbit or duck"" for the image and the reference for rest of my review.For decades now, the Rabbit or Duck illusion has been presented as a test for level of creativity. What you notice in the image determines what part in your brain is more active. A lot of people look at Duck only, Some people see Rabbit only and some see both.Of course you can see both if you know that it's an illusion and you pay way too much attention to it and if you try to look for it.However, the real trick is (and this is the next level - not part of the original illusion but something that Raghavan has done here), that what if there is no illusion? But being used to the concept of illusion, we are forced to look for both Rabbit and the Duck.Andhadhun - There is no duck. It's only a rabbit.In the last scene of the movie, the waitress from the Restaurant comes outside and gives Ayushman his cane back. This Cane has a Rabbit at its handle (Raghavan starts his Rabbit/Duck illusion here)The movie begins with Ayushman's voice telling Radhika - ""bahut lambi kahaani hai....Coffee? - It's a very long story...Coffee?"" (This line is repeated towards the end and that's how the audience know, that Ayushman is telling the story of his life to Radhika)But interestingly, the story telling takes a pause right towards the climax (when Ayushman and Doctor in the story are driving off)...the scene cuts to London and Radhika says - ""Aur phir? (and then?)""This is sort of the writer's way of writing an Epilogue solely to ""create the illusion of creating an illusion"". In the Epilogue story, where Ayushman tells the story of Tabu's accident and how the rabbit jumped and caused the accident - there are only 2 souls that can know about the Rabbit. 1- Tabu (who was distracted) and 2- Rabbit (because it caused the distraction)...Even Ayushman won't know because he was blind. So very clearly, Raghavan tells you that Ayushman is simply bluffing in this final piece.Now some may say that the shooter also saw the rabbit and he could have come and told Ayushmaan (blah, blah) - but I am basing my explanation on what is shown. Not on, what is not shown and is pure conjecture.Here is one more thing - Tabu dying would have been a bigger piece of Info which Radhika would already be aware of since the case was such a high profile one, but she seems to get all this info first hand from Ayushman, completely oblivious of Tabu's whereabouts until that moment.So Raghavan very cleverly tells the truth, but by that time- we the audience are so trapped in this brilliant tale of our hearts wanting to continue in the suspense, that we want to believe there is an illusion for sure.Raghavan even more clearly tells it very loud and clear that there is no illusion- by having Ayushman's cane with a Rabbit(or duck) handle, clearly saying- that Ayushman is selling the illusion because he has no way of validating the presence of Rabbit but he is telling that in his story.It is absolutely a delightful way of gripping your audience by having them look for things that they invent as they go.Adhadhundh (the original word not the movie title - notice the spelling difference) - basically means, something that happens extremely fast and recklessly without any validation or thought - Exactly what the ending is.Fantastic!",positive,"[['Andhadhun'], [], ['a review', 'that experience', 'an audience'], ['Hope', 'Adhadhun', 'today'], ['a post', 'the first time', 'Director', 'version', 'the audience', 'interpretation.However', 'today', 'the film', 'it.Before', 'the meaning', 'the phenomena', 'Rabbit', 'Duck', 'illusion'], ['Google', 'Rabbit', 'duck', 'the image', 'the reference', 'rest', 'review.For', 'Rabbit', 'Duck', 'illusion', 'a test', 'level', 'creativity'], ['the image', 'part', 'brain'], ['A lot', 'Duck', 'Rabbit', 'both.Of course', 'an illusion', 'way', 'much attention', 'it.However', 'the real trick', 'the next level', 'part', 'the original illusion', 'something', 'Raghavan', 'no illusion'], ['the concept', 'illusion', 'Rabbit', 'Duck.Andhadhun', 'no duck'], ['a rabbit.In', 'the last scene', 'the movie', 'the waitress', 'Restaurant', 'Ayushman', 'cane'], ['Cane', 'Rabbit', 'handle', 'Raghavan', 'Rabbit/Duck illusion', 'The movie', 'Ayushman', 'voice', 'Radhika', 'bahut', 'lambi kahaani', 'hai', '....

40,Aliens,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0229641/,"I have been long a fan of the orignal ""Alien"", but somehow I never saw this sequel until now. If this were in fact the first or only ""alien"" movie, I would undoubtedly rate it higher than I do. It's edge of your set, exciting, and much better than most movies of this type. The special effects are great, and there are some real scary moments.But to say this is ""as good"" or ""beter"" than the original--that I cannot agree with.First of all, there is very litte original in this sequel. Indeed, it is more of a remake of the first Alien than a progression. The plot if very similar, and indeed, the ending is basically the same idea, right down to Sigourney Weaver in her underwear. So the mere fact that is not original is to be considered. What Aliens offers over Alien, is faster pacing, more and bigger aliens, and a generally higher adrenaline level. This is probably why a lot of people prefer it. And it is all very well done.But Aliens is basically a military shoot-em-up. The original, for all its comparative simplicity, is a much more subtle, deftly constructed, and very atmpospheric movie.  The spareness creates a feeling of claustrophobia and terror which is very effective and memorable.  I found Alien truly psychologically frightening, while Aliens is more of an in your face adrenaline rush.  Alien also has a more interesting cast, more human and subtle. The military posturing of the Aliens cast was pretty standard stuff. Sigourney Weaver, of course, is possibly even better than in the first movie. I also like the music in the first movie better.
I find Leonard Maltin's comment on the Alien inexplicable. What he seems not to like about the first movie is there in spades in the second movie.Aliens is a darn good movie, but Alien is a sci-fi classic.",negative,"[['a fan', 'Alien', 'this sequel'], ['fact', 'movie', 'rate'], ['edge', 'set', 'this type'], ['some real scary moments.But', 'beter', 'litte original', 'this sequel'], ['a remake', 'Alien', 'a progression'], ['The plot', 'the same idea', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'underwear'], ['the mere fact'], ['Alien', 'adrenaline level'], ['a lot'], ['Aliens', 'a military shoot-em-up'], ['comparative simplicity', 'atmpospheric movie'], ['The spareness', 'a feeling', 'claustrophobia', 'terror'], ['Alien', 'face', 'adrenaline', 'rush'], ['Alien', 'interesting cast'], ['The military posturing', 'Aliens', 'cast', 'standard stuff'], ['Sigourney Weaver', 'course', 'the first movie'], ['the music', 'the first movie'], ['Leonard Maltin', 'comment', 'Alien', 'inexplicable'], ['the first movie', 'a darn good movie', 'Alien', 'a sci-fi classic']]","[['fan', 'Alien', 'sequel'], ['fact', 'movie', 'rate'], ['edge', 'set', 'movies', 'type'], ['special effects', 'real scary moments.But', 'beter', 'litte original', 'sequel'], ['remake', 'first Alien', 'progression'], ['plot', 'same idea', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'underwear'], ['mere fact'], ['Alien', 'aliens', 'adrenaline level'], ['lot of people'], ['done.But Aliens', 'military shoot-em-up'], ['comparative simplicity', 'atmpospheric movie'], ['spareness', 'feeling of claustrophobia', 'terror'], ['Alien', 'Aliens', 'face adrenaline rush'], ['Alien', 'interesting cast'], ['military posturing', 'Aliens cast', 'standard stuff'], ['Sigourney Weaver', 'course', 'first movie'], ['music', 'first movie'], ['Leonard Maltin', 'comment', 'Alien inexplicable'], ['first movie', 'spades', 'second movie.Aliens', 'darn good movie', 'Alien', 'sci-fi classic']]"
41,Aliens,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4061568/,"Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the original ""Alien"", returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love.  I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it.

42,Das Boot,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1452602/,"One of the few movies that shows the war from a German perspective (the more recent ""Downfall"" is also unmissable) and makes for compelling viewing. You identify with the despair, the youngsters' need to ""go home"", the loves left behind, the fear of dying, the dawning enormity of their action as they recede from the survivors in the sea, the sheer fatigue of continuing when every nerve yearns to be free of the boat's confines - the pressures of war, and marvel at the courageous human will that keeps defying all odds and surviving.I found myself on edge for the entire movie, feeling as trapped inside the sub as the crew and even cheering as the boat surfaced in the end against all odds and then, mourning the futility of it all. The movie succeeds in showing the war as a very human tragedy, forcing us to not hide behind anonymous ""enemy"" tags. Among many tragic moments, especially poignant is the scene where the captain recants the incident of watching the survivors cry for help. You can almost see his eyes glistening.

44,North by Northwest,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0068499/,"Possibly the greatest ever thriller, NbNW combines terrific acting, dialogue, cinematography, music and storyline. But the real standout is the editing. If there was ever a film that merited the cliché ""a nonstop thrill ride"", it's this one. The pace never slackens. I particularly like how it cuts straight from the Mt Rushmore face to the train bunkbed. I hate the anticlimactic, overlong, hokey endings of most thrillers. The final scene (scenelet) is very short, romantic dénouement, à la James Bond. How refreshing.Oh, the champagne dialogue in this movie is simply premier cru, darlings! Eve: ""You don't believe in marriage."" - Thornhill [indignant]: ""But I've been married twice."" - Eve: ""See what I mean?"" Or take this repartee... Vandamm: ""Seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI, and a little more from the Actors' Studio."" - Thornhill: ""Apparently, the only performance that'll satisfy you is when I play dead."" - Vandamm: ""Your very next role. You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.""The dialogue is also very risqué for a 1950s film in places. In the dining car, for example, Thornhill: ""The moment I meet an attractive woman, I have to start pretending I have no desire to make love to her."" This thinly-veiled propositioning of Eve/Eva for sex, which sounds banal these days, would have been outrageously shocking to its original 50s audience. Likewise, ""I'm a big girl."" - ""Yeah, and in all the right places, too."" A cliché now, but imagine its impact then. ""I've heard nothing but innuendoes,"" says Vandamm at one stage. He's right; there are plenty in this movie's verbal and visual imagery.This dialogue, and the general production design, conspire to create product that, unlike other Hitchcock thrillers like Rear Window and Psycho, doesn't appear dated now. The design is ultramodernist, which is reflected in the architecture of the locations like the NYC UN HQ and the Rushmore lodge.A convoluted plot is usually the result of bad scripting or an attempt to mask a movie's deficiencies in other areas. As usual, Hitchcock keeps the plot dead simple and doesn't complicate matters by trying to explain. It's just some kind of meaningless Cold War spy thing. This perfectly suffices, for it's quite incidental to the thrilling chase that forms the core of the film. What seem like hokey, incredible contrivances, such as Eve's coming on so strong to Thornhill in the dining car (when we think her unaware that he's not a real murderer) are soon enough fascinatingly demystified. (She's in cahoots with Vandamm, or, as we later find, an undercover agent trying to expose him!)Fantastic performances from Cary Grant, James Mason, Eva-Marie Saint and a much-underused Martin Landau. If there's one criticism, it's that Cary Grant is preternaturally unflappable as the urban sophisticate plunged into a living nightmare. He always retains his self-assured, even arrogant, panache and never panics. In fact, with that ever-present twinkle in his eye, he seems to be getting perverse enjoyment from his own misfortunes. However, his modulated performance remains just the right side of comicality.Eva-Marie Saint is camera-loved as the lethal seductress. She seems the perfect Bond girl. Had her star risen a few years later, I'm sure she'd have been captivating Connery. In fact, this movie shows that Hitchcock could have directed James Bond. It's no secret Bond's film incarnation was modelled to some extent on Cary Grant's supersuave persona in this film.A young-looking Martin Landau is effective as the menacing sidekick, although it's only in the final scene in the Rushmore lodge that he has any quality screen time or lines. James Mason underplays the role of the polished, oleaginous villain perfectly. His very British voice and demeanour conveys menace by suggestion, not overt declaration. He too, like Saint, would have been ideal in a Bond film. He doesn't sound ridiculous mouthing lines like, ""A bit naughty, using real bullets!"" [my paraphrase][Continuity: In the scene in Eve's hotel room, Thornhill calls for the valet to sponge and press his suit. He's told it'll take 20 minutes and a guy comes to collect the suit a minute later. He pretends to take a shower, whilst Eve absconds. Thornhill leaves immediately, and he doesn't return to the hotel. However, in the next scene, we see him wearing the same suit, perfectly sponged and pressed. There's no way he could have returned to the hotel to collect the suit.]",negative,"[['thriller', 'NbNW', 'terrific', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'cinematography', 'music', 'storyline'], ['the real

45,North by Northwest,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1058631/,"VERTIGO did nothing to advance Hitchcock's career in 1957 when he released it, and it's actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial, escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of Cary Grant, as an added note. This could well amount to be the first James Bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick, an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic ""boss,"" a dashing hero, lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.NORTH BY NORTHWEST has one crucial difference to any James Bond film, though: Alfred Hitchcock. While the Bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff (although fluff of the better kind until the franchise ran out of gas in the 80s), Hitchcock, always the master of subtext as well as suspense, creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension, sexual innuendo, comedy, and mounting suspense seamlessly. There is never the feeling of being bored as there is too much going on, especially with the sizzling chemistry of Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant, by now a Hitchcock veteran. When they're on screen, dialog crackles and so much more is said with so little gesture -- she closes the lid on her Ice Goddess role, but gives it a nice, cheeky, knowing wink. He of course evolves from the sort of man who while looking and being slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb -- once it becomes clear he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot that only later becomes clear -- becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands. A quintessential Hitchcock Everyman, Grant has his stamp all over his role. No one can imagine anyone else running away from that crop duster in one of the movies many standout sequences, or saying the reassuring last words to Eva Marie Saint as they cuddle together in the train. When one thinks of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one thinks Cary Grant.Easily one of Hitchcock's best films, made while he was at the peak of his career in the bracket formed with THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and MARNIE. Great supporting performances are all over the map, from Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother, James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, Martin Landau as Vandamm's protégée who might be a little more than that, and Leo G Carroll as The Professor. Doreen Lang appears early in the movie as Grant's secretary; she would of course be remembered as the woman who shrieks at Tippi Hedren in THE BIRDS and gets slapped by her as the camera holds itself tight on her face.",positive,"[['VERTIGO', 'nothing', 'Hitchcock', 'career', 'a shame', 'the following year', 'the slow-moving erotic thriller', 'genre', 'something', 'single-handedly create', 'the spy movie'], ['Ian Fleming', 'author', 'James Bond', 'character', 'the suave personality', 'Cary Grant', 'an added note'], ['James Bond', 'film', 'a dangerous villain', 'a sidekick', 'woman', 'a dubious nature', 'boss', 'a dashing', 'hero', 'the scene', 'danger.NORTH', 'BY NORTHWEST', 'crucial difference', 'James Bond', 'film', 'Alfred Hitchcock'], ['Bond', 'quintessential action', 'fluff', 'fluff', 'kind', 'the franchise', 'gas', 'Hitchcock', 'the master', 'subtext', 'suspense', 'sexual tension', 'sexual innuendo', 'comedy', 'suspense'], ['the feeling', 'chemistry', 'Eva Marie Saint', 'Cary Grant', 'Hitchcock', 'veteran'], ['screen', 'dialog', 'little gesture', 'the lid', 'Ice Goddess', 'role', 'wink'], ['course', 'the sort', 'man', 'mother', 'thumb', 'a target', 'a sinister', 'plot'], ['Hitchcock Everyman', 'Grant', 'stamp', 'role'], ['No one', 'anyone', 'that crop', 'duster', 'many standout', 'the reassuring', 'Eva Marie Saint', 'the train'], ['NORTH BY NORTHWEST', 'Cary Grant.Easily', 'Hitchcock', 'the peak', 'career', 'the bracket', 'THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH', 'MARNIE'], ['Great', 'the map', 'Jesse Royce Landis', 'Grant', 'mother', 'James Mason', 'Phillip Vandamm', 'Martin Landau', 'Vandamm', 'protégée', 'Leo G Carroll', 'Professor'], ['Doreen Lang', 'the movie', 'Grant', 'secretary', 'course', 'the woman', 'Tippi Hedren', 'THE BIRDS', 'the camera', 'face']]","[['VERTIGO', 'nothing', 'Hitchcock', 'career', 'shame', 'following year', 'thriller genre', 'something', 'single-handedly create', 'spy movie'], ['Ian Fleming', 'author', 'James Bond novels', 'states', 'character', 'physical characteristics', 'personality of Cary Grant', 'added note'], ['James Bond film', 'dangerous villain', 'sidekick', 'woman', 'dubious nature', 'boss', 'dashing hero', 'lush locales', 'scene', 'powerful chases', 'danger.NORTH BY NORTHWEST', 'crucial difference', 'James Bond film', 'Alfred Hitchcock'], ['Bond films', 'action fluff', 'fluff', 'kind', 'franchise', 'gas', 'Hitchcock', 'master of subtext', 'suspense', 'memorable scenes', 'sexual tension', 'sexual innuendo', 'comedy', 'suspense'], ['feeling', 'chemistry of Eva Marie Saint', 'Cary Grant', 'Hitchcock veteran'], ['screen', 'dialog crackles', 'little gesture', 'lid', 'Ice Goddess role', 'wink'], ['course evolves', 'sort of man', 'mother', 'thumb', 'target', 'sinister plot', 'matters', 'own hands'], ['Hitchcock Everyman', 'Grant', 'stamp', 'role'], ['one', 'anyone', 'crop duster', 'movies', 'standout sequences', 'reassuring', 'last words', 'Eva Marie Saint', 'train'], ['NORTH BY NORTHWEST', 'Cary Grant.Easily', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'peak', 'career', 'bracket', 'THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH', 'MARNIE'], ['Great', 'performances', 'map', 'Jesse Royce Landis', 'Grant', 'mother', 'James Mason', 'Phillip Vandamm', 'Martin Landau', 'Vandamm', 'protégée', 'Leo G Carroll', 'Professor'], ['Doreen Lang', 'movie as Grant', 'secretary', 'course', 'woman', 'Tippi Hedren', 'THE BIRDS', 'camera', 'face']]"
46,Vertigo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1230128/,"Although it got at best mixed reviews when first released, Vertigo is now considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films. A tribute to the players, the director, and the composer of that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever.The music is probably more important here than in most films, let alone most Hitchcock films. Because for most of the first half of the film and a great deal of the second half, it is without dialogue. In fact Kim Novak does not have a spoken line until about 48 minutes into the little more than 2 hour feature. She's under James Stewart's surveillance and the whole story of his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions and through Bernard Herrmann's music.Stewart is a cop retired on disability who is hired by an old college friend Tom Helmore to follow his wife. Helmore tells Stewart a tale about his wife falling under the spirit of her dead great grandmother who committed suicide. The wife he's following is played by Kim Novak. Novak in fact makes a suicide attempt and by jumping into San Francisco bay and Stewart jumps in and saves her.In a brief prologue the reason for Stewart's disability is told. While on the police force, he lost a man while pursuing the suspect in a rooftop chase. Another cop was killed trying to save Stewart who had slipped and was hanging on to a roof gutter for his dear life. After that Stewart acquired an understandable fear of heights with accompanying dizziness, vertigo.Later on at an old mission which has significance for Novak's family, Novak runs up to the top of the bell tower and Stewart because of his Vertigo can't pursue her to prevent her from jumping off and taking her life.Later on he spots Kim Novak again with a different color hair and this time essentially stalks her until they meet. By now he's totally obsessed with the dead Novak who he fell in love with.Alfred Hitchcock is plumbing some depths of the human psyche in Vertigo. Certainly good old all American Jimmy Stewart would not be one you would think of casting as a voyeur and a stalker. But he pulls off the performance in probably the film with the least dialogue Alfred Hitchcock ever made since sound came in.Kim Novak is hauntingly beautiful in Vertigo, she has to be or the whole plot would make no sense. Barbara Bel Geddes is in this also as Stewart's girl friend who finds herself losing him to an obsession with a ghost. She also serves as a sounding board for Stewart as he expresses some of his feelings to her.This was the first of two films Stewart and Novak made together. Ironically enough the second one, Bell Book and Candle, is about a witch played by Novak who actually uses witchcraft to ensnare Stewart. Given Stewart's obsession with Novak in Vertigo, if Hitchcock had thrown in witchcraft into the plot, the audience would certainly have believed it.Of course this is an Alfred Hitchcock film and therefore not all is as it seems. I can't sat any more, but there are no happy endings for anyone in this haunting film.",negative,"[['Vertigo', 'Alfred Hitchcock'], ['A tribute', 'the director', 'the composer', 'musical score', 'music', 'Hitchcock'], ['the first half', 'the film', 'a great deal', 'the second half', 'dialogue'], ['fact', 'Kim Novak', 'a spoken line', 'hour', 'feature'], ['James Stewart', 'surveillance', 'the whole story', 'obsession', 'Bernard Herrmann', 'music.Stewart', 'a cop', 'disability', 'an old college', 'friend', 'Tom Helmore', 'wife'], ['Helmore', 'Stewart', 'a tale', 'wife', 'the spirit', 'dead great grandmother', 'suicide'], ['The wife', 'Kim Novak'], ['Novak', 'fact', 'a suicide attempt', 'San Francisco', 'bay', 'Stewart', 'a brief prologue', 'the reason', 'Stewart', 'disability'], ['the police', 'force', 'a man', 'the suspect', 'a rooftop chase'], ['Another cop', 'Stewart', 'a roof', 'gutter', 'dear life'], ['Stewart', 'an understandable fear', 'dizziness', 'vertigo.Later', 'an old mission', 'significance', 'Novak', 'family', 'Novak', 'the top', 'the bell', 'tower', 'Stewart', 'Vertigo', 'life.Later', 'Kim Novak', 'a different color', 'hair', 'this time'], ['Novak', 'love', 'Hitchcock', 'the human psyche', 'Vertigo'], ['Jimmy Stewart', 'a voyeur', 'a stalker'], ['the performance', 'the film', 'dialogue', 'Alfred Hitchcock', 'sound', 'Novak', 'Vertigo', 'the whole plot', 'no sense'], ['Barbara Bel Geddes', 'Stewart', 'girl', 'friend', 'an obsession', 'a ghost'], ['board', 'Stewart', 'Stewart', 'Novak'], ['Bell Book', 'Candle', 'a witch', 'Novak', 'witchcraft', 'Stewart'], ['Stewart', 'obsession', 'Novak', 'Vertigo', 'Hitchcock', 'witchcraft', 'the plot', 'the audience', 'it.Of course', 'Alfred Hitchcock', 'film'], ['anyone', 'this haunting', 'film']]","[['mixed reviews', 'Vertigo', 'Alfred Hitchcock', 'classic films'], ['tribute', 'players', 'director', 'composer', 'musical score', 'music', 'films', 'Hitchcock films'], ['first half', 'film', 'great deal', 'second half', 'dialogue'], ['fact Kim Novak', 'spoken line', 'minutes', 'hour feature'], ['James Stewart', 'surveillance', 'whole story', 'obsession', 'facial expressions', 'Bernard Herrmann', 'music.Stewart', 'cop', 'disability', 'college friend Tom Helmore', 'wife'], ['Helmore', 'Stewart', 'tale', 'wife', 'spirit', 'dead great grandmother', 'suicide'], ['wife', 'Kim Novak'], ['Novak in fact', 'suicide attempt', 'San Francisco bay', 'Stewart jumps', 'saves', 'brief prologue', 'reason for Stewart', 'disability'], ['police force', 'man', 'suspect', 'rooftop chase'], ['cop', 'Stewart', 'roof gutter', 'dear life'], ['Stewart', 'fear of heights', 'dizziness', 'vertigo.Later', 'old mission', 'significance for Novak', 'family', 'Novak', 'top', 'bell tower', 'Stewart', 'Vertigo', 'life.Later', 'Kim Novak', 'color hair', 'time'], ['dead Novak', 'love', 'Hitchcock', 'depths', 'psyche in Vertigo'], ['Jimmy Stewart', 'voyeur', 'stalker'], ['performance', 'film', 'dialogue Alfred Hitchcock', 'sound', 'in.Kim Novak', 'Vertigo', 'whole plot', 'sense'], ['Barbara Bel Geddes', 'Stewart', 'girl friend', 'obsession', 'ghost'], ['board for Stewart', 'feelings', 'films Stewart', 'Novak'], ['Bell Book', 'Candle', 'witch', 'Novak', 'witchcraft', 'Stewart'], ['Stewart', 'obsession with Novak', 'Vertigo', 'Hitchcock', 'witchcraft', 'plot', 'audience', 'it.Of course', 'Alfred Hitchcock film'], ['endings for anyone', 'haunting film']]"
47,Vertigo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0066408/,"Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous ""blondes""), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.""To reveal more,"" as Leonard Maltin wrote, ""would be unthinkable.""While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!One of the all-time greats.

49,Double Indemnity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0030161/,"This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.
Barbara Stanwyck, in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career, represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death, if necessary) in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the `femme fatale,' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess, seductiveness, and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films, the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead, as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson, the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity) and Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff, her victim'), have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed, and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that, their mutually calculated interaction, although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen, is exactly as it was meant to be, because it represents each character's intentions, even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter, conversely, methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly, and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise (and sinister) intentions, and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film, Edward G. Robinson, plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company, having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's (and Walter's, technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end, the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances, the brilliant and imaginative direction, and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent, excellent filmmaking, and is a classic film that should not be missed.",positive,"[['all time', 'story', 'the acting', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'the way', 'the story'], ['the time', 'the film', 'the idea', 'the killer', 'the opening', 'scene', 'the audience', 'the film', 'the goal', 'Billy Wilder', 'the director'], ['the perpetrator', 'emphasis', 'the crime', 'the murder', 'Barton Keyes', 'the insurance', 'investigator', 'the case', 'kind', 'person', 'Walter Neff'], ['Barbara Stanwyck', 'extensive career', 'flawless ease', 'ruthless manipulator', 'no difficulty', 'death', 'order'], ['the film', 'community', 'femme fatale', 'someone', 'sexual prowess', 'seductiveness', 'emotional detachment', 'an unsuspecting person', 'an interested man', 'a scheme', 'destruction'], ['the man', 'life', 'the case', 'the fate', 'the femme fatale'], ['Barbara Stanwyck', 'Phyllis Dietrichson', 'the murderous femme fatale', 'Double Indemnity', 'Fred MacMurray', 'Walter Neff', '\x91victim', 'amazing chemistry', 'screen'], ['attraction', 'the development', 'relationship'], ['interaction', 'the screen', 'each character', 'future'], ['Phyllis', 'every word', 'Walter', 'head'], ['the idea', 'life', 'insurance', 'Walter', 'the beginning', 'some time', 'the prospect', 'husband', 'order', 'fortune'], ['Walter', 'something', 'Phyllis'], ['stiff dialogue', 'Phyllis', 'Walter', 'precise', 'sinister', 'quick pace', 'a feeling', 'urgency', 'entertaining actor', 'the film', 'Edward G.

51,M,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1329724/,"Fritz Lang's highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany, where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement, and ended in the United States in 1953 with the production of The Big Heat, a film noir classic. Perhaps his greatest film, M (Germany, 1931) forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. Even though M was Lang's (and Germany's) first sound film, many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late 1920's. While most early ""talkies"" return films to their static, visually monotonous, stage- imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium, M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous, off-screen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue. The film's editing, particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting, also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling. Of course, many of the film's sound effects are also imaginative and memorable, none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film's central character, the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert (magnificently played by Peter Lorre). Sound is also an important contributor to M's rich and influential use of off screen space. One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster, creepily intoning to his next victim, Elsie Beckmann, ""You have a very pretty ball."" Not only is Beckert's shadow a bow toward Lang's expressionist artistic roots, but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image - that is, among us, the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuous-appearing, albeit monstrous, member. Another example of Lang's use of off-screen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsie's absence from them: an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table, the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsie's mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughter's arrival, the attic play area that awaits Elsie's return from school. Most memorable of all - and most often alluded to visually in other films - is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckert's assault and murder of the innocent child, representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsie's ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame. Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated images.Beyond its technical brilliance, the keys to M's lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckert's twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and ""trial."" Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer, Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath. Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clear-cut. To be sure, the gut-reaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who, beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry, capture Beckert and bring him to a mock- formal trial whose conclusion is foregone. Like many in America today, Beckert's accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the ""monster"" in the surest way possible: a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible. Considering the heinousness of Beckert's crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again, this emotional response is hard to resist. Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism - quite the contrary. Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckert's unkempt ""court appointed"" defense attorney and Beckert's own impassioned monologue, Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others (guilty or not) in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in 1930s Germany. That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks, dresses, and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident. Moreover, the letter ""M"" chalked on Beckert's back by one of his pursuers not only stands for ""murderer"" but also alludes to God's marking of Cain. While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil, it in fact represents God's warning to Cain's flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance, but to leave justice in God's hands. Translated into secular terms (and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame), God's hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert ""in the name of the Law.""",positive,"[['Fritz Lang', 'influential career', 'a film', 'director', 'post', 'World War', 'Germany', 'a leading figure', 'Expressionist', 'film', 'movement',

Martin C. SmithManoj Bajpai wants revenge on Tigmanshu Dhulia who had treacherously killed his father. Sometimes there comes a story which has an epic kind of sweep. Spanning generations, introducing several characters, all caught up in empire building, love, lust and enimity. There isn't much point to them, the protagonists aren't clearly defined, the storyline meandering, their lives entwined in the events that befell the nation and the small town that the story inhabits. Set in the backdrop of Wasseypur, a small part of Dhanbad, capital of India's coal belt, numerous characters come and go. India gains independence, Emergency is imposed, coal mining is first unionized and later nationalized. However, the story, at its core remains about Tigmanshu's star rising ever higher and Manoj building his own empire from humble origins, while seeking revenge.There are times when you wish things would happen quicker. That there were less characters. Or that there was a point to some of them, who are introduced to either only die or shine bright for a few frames before being forgotten. The environment is beautifully captured, including the lingo, the mannerisms whether it's the abject despair of the poor mine worker, condemned to live his life in the black shafts. The bestiality of the butcher, as he hacks away at his meat. The cowardice of the cops. The empty bravado of the minister's goons. Or the naked lust as hungry men eye their next catch, the woman to slake their base desires, even as the wife lies at home, pregnant. However, there are several things which let the film down. For a film set in the coal belt, we see very little of it. Apart from one memorable scene where, caked in the black coaldust, a few men fight for their lives and another where coals water absorption properties are highlighted, there is too little was about the black mineral and much more made of ancillary businesses. National events of importance are also given short shrift or brushed over, their impact shown quickly, transitions happening smoothly rather than in real life where each change creates havoc in such a tiny eco-system. Great camera work, flawless performances, several one-liners and very catchy music keep you engaged, though, as our two key protagonists slug it out and religion comes in, with different sects of Muslims engaging in war amongst each other.

I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn't have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog, acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this.

One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact the secondary acting is all first-class.

60,L.A. Confidential,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1282061/,"LA Confidential is a sprawling epic tale of crime, corruption and justice in Hollywood and the LAPD, with a cast to match. A truly gripping crime saga exposing the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels, where cops never let the truth get in the way of justice, and everyone knows everyone else's dirty secrets.Criminally overlooked at both the box office and the Academy thanks to the all-conquering and over-achieving Titanic, LA Confidential will far more likely stand the test of time to be thought of as one of the best films of the 90s, and possibly the best cop film ever.After cops give a number of inmates a beating in retaliation for two of their own being put in hospital, the career-minded Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) agrees to testify to what he saw, turning in his fellow officers. When one of the cops forced out turns up dead as a result of a shooting, Exley, hothead detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) and fame-obsessed Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) all work to find the answers. However, as they uncover the truth, it leads to more questions, of corruption, blackmail, bribery and conspiracy.The film superbly portrays the dual nature of Hollywood; glamorous parties and beautiful people, and the seemingly ever-present crime and corruption, even in the police. Danny Devito's opening monologue perfectly sums it up - 'There's trouble in paradise'. This is not the city at the end of the rainbow, the city where dreams come true.A series of stellar performances from an all-star cast makes it impossible to pick the star, although Kim Basinger richly deserved her Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Spacey is terrific as ever, while Russell Crowe shows that Gladiator wasn't his first muscles-with-a-heart role. But the real standout is probably Guy Pearce in a career-making performance as the one officer determined to what is right and just, regardless of the potentially disastrous consequences for him. However, LA Confidential is a true ensemble piece, and everybody holds their own among the starry cast. Few will have made many better films, before or since.Curtis Hanson directs in a career-defining role, the sweeping direction echoing the sprawling nature of both the story and the city. The story is a slow-burner, gradually unraveling all the twists, but instead of clearing up the mystery, the waters become muddier as the trio of officers are forced to work together. Hanson masterfully commands the James Ellroy's source material, weaving it into a gripping multi-layered tale. The characters are extremely well developed, all three-dimensional, with no clear-cut heroes and villains. White (Crowe) in particular is the classic film noir anti-hero, the violent cop with a heart-breaking story, thinking with his muscles rather than his brain. LA Confidential is a classic 50s noir film told for the 90s, and keeps you guessing right up to the final scene as to how high the corruption goes. The two-hour running time is never felt.A superb thriller and the perfect antidote to the rash of mindless action-comedies that frequently come out of Hollywood today, LA Confidential harks back to how film-making used to be  all about telling a story. And what a story it is.

62,Heat,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1041259/,"There is so much more to Heat than whats on its surface. It is so well directed, acted,written, scored and photographed that it takes mulitple viewings to take it all in. This is the best crime movie ever made. And, since my first viewing over 5 years ago, I have seen it a countless number of times. After all of these viewings I can only say that this is my favorite film to watch and therefore the best film I have ever seen. I will not divulge into plot because the expanse and depth of the films story, I could not do justice with a shorthand overview of its plot. This film is not about its plot, it is about its characters and what they feel. Michael Mann is my favorite filmmaker, his list of credits, admittedly, doesn't strike many people as the resume of the greatest living director, but when you watch those films you can see the gift this man possesses at telling a story and making us feel for his characters. There are three scenes in this movie that had me so drawn in, I still think about them often. One is the films first scene, Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing electronic score captivates us in the first shots of the train carrying Neal McCauley (Robert DeNiro)and leave me, and the audience wanting more. The third comes toward the end as McCauley and his boss Nate (a wonderful Jon Voigt) exchange their last words as Neal is planning on leaving the country the words the choose and attitudes they strike almost had me in tears. These are two hard men and this is far as they will go with their heartfelt goodbyes. The films last scene I will not give a description to as not to ruin the plot for you. I contains the best (almost) wordless exchange I've ever seen in a film. The music swells and Mann allows us to linger on the last shot. It brought me to tears, and still does.

63,Heat,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0363537/,"Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action.

64,Die Hard,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2250278/,"Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",negative,"[['the non-action', 'a tad slow', 'comparison', 'Die Hard', 'thing', 'the action', 'the cinematography'], ['John McTiernon', 'Hunt', 'Red October', 'Action Hero', 'a vast majority', 'the time', 'a terrific score', 'Michael Kamen', 'some intelligent', 'witty scripting', 'a plot'], ['some excellent acting'], ['Bruce Willis', 'character', 'Alan Rickman', 'the acting', 'honours', 'Hans Gruber'], ['Gruber', 'suave', 'menacing', 'opinion', 'Rickman', 'a character'], ['a superb movie', 'Die Hard', 'franchise', 'the action', 'genre'], ['Bethany Cox']]","[['non-action parts', 'slow in comparison', 'many things', 'Die Hard', 'thing', 'action', 'cinematography'], ['John McTiernon', 'Hunt for Red October', 'Action Hero', 'vast majority', 'time', 'score by Michael Kamen', 'intelligent', 'witty scripting', 'plot'], ['excellent acting'], ['Bruce Willis', 'character', 'Willis handles', 'Alan Rickman', 'acting honours', 'Hans Gruber'], ['Gruber', 'suave and menacing', 'opinion', 'Rickman', 'character'], ['superb movie', 'Die Hard franchise', 'action genre'], ['Bethany Cox']]"
65,Die Hard,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4052895/,"Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) 
McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today.",positive,"[['Die Hard', 'the first action', 'film', 'action', 'all time', 'till', 'this day'], ['number', 'personal favorite action', 'movie', 'all time', 'this movie', 'death'], [], ['this movie', 'man', 'a team', 'plastic'], ['Bruce Willis', 'performance', 'this movie', 'John McClane', 'role'], ['number', 'personal favorite action', 'movie', 'all time', 'this movie', 'death'], ['stay', 'heart', 'forever'], ['this film', 'a building', 'bunch'], ['This film', 'heart', 'soul'], ['A lot', 'that premise', 'no movie', 'Die Hard'], ['a modern day', 'action', 'film', 'the action', 'genre'], ['this film', 'a teenager', 'mom', 'ultimate thrill', 'ride'], ['everyone', 'the lead character'], ['McClane', 'no help', 'gun', 'the only help', 'Sgt'], ['Al Powell', 'a radio', 'cop'], ['bond'], ['McClane', 'something', 'crazy'], ['this summer', 'July'], ['this film', 'death', 'hugh fan', 'Die Hard', 'this film'], ['this movie', 'a widescreen', 'a movie', 'theater'], ['John McTiernan', 'Roderick Thorp Nothing', 'Forever'], ['a masterpiece action', 'film', 'all action', 'man', 'army', 'a confined space'], ['the first one', 'the action', 'genre'], ['This movie', 'everything'], ['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller', 'great dialogue'], ['building', 'great helicopter', 'explosion', 'action'], ['John McClane', 'man', 'a whole team'], ['Action Thriller', 'Die Hard', 'heart-stopping suspense'], ['great cast', 'great plot', 'no shaky cam', 'CGI'], ['Great Direction', 'John McTiernan', 'everyone'], ['Everyone', 'an excellent job'], ['Bruce Willis', 'a bad ass', 'action', 'star', 'John McClane'], ['a great bad-ass action', 'hero', 'the money', 'a vault', 'bearer', 'the building', 'vault'], ['favorite action', 'part', 'Die Hard', 'McClane', 'the fire', 'hose', 'body', 'the helicopter'], ['Gruber', 'McLane', 'the roof'], ['an incredible explosion', 'the helicopter'], ['McLane', 'the side', 'the building', 'scene', 'the movie'], ['McClane', 'the elevator', 'shaft', 'Karl'], ['McClane', 'the table', 'gun', 'Marco'], ['the director', 'the proximity', 'the gun', 'Willis', 'ear', 'this scene', 'permanent hearing', 'loss', 'Willis'], ['McClane', 'shot', 'Eddie', 'action', 'a brilliant action', 'movie'], ['McClane', 'try', 'Ellis', 'Ellis', 'try'], ['McClane', 'gun', 'afraid someone', 'hijack'], ['The fight', 'Karl', 'John'], ['McClane', 'C4', 'the elevator', 'shaft', 'the entire floor', 'the cops', 'a chance'], ['The broken glass', 'scene'], ['machine', 'gun', 'Karl', 'John McClane', 'broken glass', 'barefoot', 'bad-ass scene', 'the movie', 'all time', 'favorite'], ['McClane', 'the roof', 'the beginning', 'the movie', 'awesome'], ['Karl', 'an elevator', 'shaft', 'McClane', 'a real kick-ass scene', 'this film', 'death'], ['this movie', 'John McClane', 'a real action', 'hero', 'something', 'no one', 'a team'], ['the German mastermind', 'ruthless', 'brilliant', 'anything', 'the money'], ['Alan Rickman', 'performance', 'death', 'this movie'], ['the actor', 'villain', 'the whole world'], ['LAPD Supervisor', 'Diana James', 'that girl', 'McClane', 'call', 'her', 'help'], ['Sgt'], ['Al Powell', 'McClane', 'supervisor'], ['Reginald VelJohnson', 'a brilliant performance', 'hero', 'this movie'], ['Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T.

67,Chinatown,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3789578/,"I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that's why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn't really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.In a recent New York Times piece, they called CHINATOWN ""a meditation on evil"", which is spot-on. Set in 1937, this movie is just all-round perfect, first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie, that is rich in themes (water, evil, trust, guilt, greed) and even richer in suspense, as the audience—just like our protagonist—tries to find out what is happening. The story is ""complex"" for sure, but it's not ""complicated"". Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.Besides the impeccable screenplay, everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway's stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful, the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic!

69,The Great Escape,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0081999/,"This is a great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit for. So many who say otherwise are ill-informed and obviously don't know much about the actual history of that actual escape. The depiction of what happened to the recaptured prisoners in the movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE is reasonably accurate as detailed on the historyinfilm site...specifically on the ""Reprisal"" page; along with being detailed in the various published accounts.Hitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by Goering, Feldmarschall Keitel, Maj-Gen Graevenitz and Maj-Gen Westhoff, and dictated that more than half the prisoners be shot and cremated. So, as depicted in the film, several of those recaptured were not executed and were indeed returned to confinement. In fact, even those executed were not ""shot on the spot"" for the most part, but were actually executed later after being turned over to the Gestapo; most being shot while being allowed to relieve themselves, under the guise of ""trying to escape"".Furthermore, there are many accounts as to how much more humane the environment was within the camp (which even had a popular and very successful theatre, featuring prisoners who would later be name performers) than many other POW camps...and certainly nothing like the harsh conditions associated with the Concentration or Extermination camps.To quote one source:""It must be made clear that the German Luftwaffe [the German Air Force], who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war, maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers, and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo. The Luftwaffe treated the POWs well, despite an erratic and inconsistent supply of food.Prisoners were handled quite fairly within the Geneva Convention, and the Kommandant, Oberst (Colonel) Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, was a professional and honourable soldier who won the respect of the senior prisoners.""Finally, virtually all the major engineering aspects in regards to the tunnels and the initial escape in the film are as they were actually acheived in the real escape.It would behoove some to learn a little more actual history or do a little simple research before shooting from the hip with supposed ""knowledge"" of reality. THE GREAT ESCAPE certainly takes liberties in tone and character portrayal, but not in the key elements that are disparaged out of sneering ignorance.BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also a great film, but took even greater liberties with the technical details of the events described than THE GREAT ESCAPE did....and offering up VON RYAN'S EXPRESS as a more realistic alternative is simply delusional and ridiculous.",positive,"[['a great movie', 'credit'], ['the actual history', 'that actual escape'], ['The depiction', 'the movie', 'THE GREAT ESCAPE', 'the historyinfilm', 'site', 'Reprisal', 'page', 'accounts.Hitler', 'Feldmarschall Keitel', 'Maj-Gen Graevenitz', 'Maj-Gen Westhoff'], ['the film', 'confinement'], ['fact', 'shot', 'the spot', 'part', 'Gestapo', 'the guise', 'the environment', 'the camp', 'successful theatre', 'POW', 'nothing', 'Concentration', 'Extermination', 'source', 'Luftwaffe [', 'German Air Force ]', 'Air Force', 'war', 'a degree', 'professional respect', 'the general attitude', 'the camp security', 'SS', 'Gestapo'], ['Luftwaffe', 'POWs', 'inconsistent supply', 'Geneva Convention', 'Kommandant', 'Oberst', 'Colonel', 'Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau', 'honourable soldier', 'the respect'], ['the major engineering', 'the initial escape', 'the film', 'the real escape.It', 'actual history', 'a little simple research', 'the hip', 'knowledge', 'reality'], ['ESCAPE', 'tone', 'character', 'portrayal', 'ignorance.BRIDGE', 'ON THE RIVER KWAI', 'a great film', 'THE GREAT ESCAPE', '....', 'VON RYAN', 'EXPRESS', 'realistic alternative']]","[['great movie', 'credit'], ['actual history', 'actual escape'], ['depiction', 'recaptured prisoners', 'movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE', 'historyinfilm site', 'Reprisal', 'page', 'accounts.Hitler', 'Feldmarschall Keitel', 'Maj-Gen Graevenitz', 'Maj-Gen Westhoff', 'prisoners'], ['film', 'confinement'], ['fact', 'shot', 'spot', 'part', 'Gestapo', 'guise', 'many accounts', 'environment', 'camp', 'successful theatre', 'prisoners', 'name performers', 'POW camps', 'nothing', 'harsh conditions', 'Concentration or Extermination', 'source', 'Luftwaffe [', 'German Air Force ]', 'Air Force prisoners', 'war', 'degree', 'professional respect', 'fellow flyers', 'general attitude', 'security officers', 'guards', 'SS or Gestapo'], ['Luftwaffe', 'POWs', 'supply of food.Prisoners', 'Geneva Convention', 'Kommandant', 'Oberst', 'Colonel', 'Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau', 'honourable soldier', 'respect', 'senior prisoners'], ['engineering aspects', 'regards', 'tunnels', 'initial escape', 'film', 'real escape.It', 'actual history', 'little simple research', 'hip', 'knowledge', 'reality'], ['GREAT ESCAPE', 'liberties in tone', 'character portrayal', 'key elements', 'ignorance.BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI', 'great film', 'liberties', 'technical details', 'events', 'THE GREAT ESCAPE', '....', 'VON RYAN', 'EXPRESS', 'realistic alternative']]"
70,Yojimbo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1402255/,"In the middle '20's, Dashiell Hammett (best known as author of ""The Maltese Falcon"") wrote two unrelated novels, ""The Glass Key"", about Ned Beaumont an alcoholic gambler who uses duplicity to save his mob boss from taking a murder rap for a corrupt politician (all the while fending off a rival mobster), and 'Red Harvest"", in which a nameless private eye (also alcoholic, a status shared by many Hammett heroes) is hired to clean up a small town kept in fear by two warring boot-leg mobs.I believe ""Red Harvest"" did make it to film in the '30's, but I haven't been able to track that down and never saw it. ""The Glass Key"" was first made into a (not too successful) film in 1935, and then re-made in 1942. The remake concerns us here. Directed by Stuart Heisler in a style that compounds the typical crime film briskness of the '30's with the shaded undertones of the then developing 'noir' genre, it is actually quite a good film, and in a number of ways daring for its period. True to the novel, literally everyone in the film is corrupt in some way, and especially fascinating is the appearance of William Bendix in a minor role of an overtly homosexual sadist of a thug. Alan Ladd plays Ned Beaumont as a true anti-hero, cold, calculating, true to no ethic but his own - a type Hollywood at that time was having problems presenting, since the strong ethics of the character undercut all the assumptions of sociopathy of such types popular at the time. The film finally betrays itself with a ""kiss-and-make-up"" final scene that completely undercuts the ethical problematic of the novel (in which Beaumont finally betrays his boss by running off with the boss' fiancée). But until then, the movie moves towards its dark ""who-dun-it"" revelation rapidly and filled with tension.There is a scene dead center in ""The Glass Key"" where Beaumont is captured by the rival mob boss and tortured by the sadistic thug (which is from the novel), and filled with Freudian undertones due to the homosexuality of the torturing thug (Bendix) (also implicit in the novel). I think it was Japanese cinema expert Donald Ritchie from whom I remember an anecdote that it was this scene that fascinated Akira Kurosawa to such an extent that he felt compelled to make a film based on a Hammett novel. Interestingly, he did not do a remake of ""The Glass Key"", however. Instead, he transposed ""Red Harvest"" to the Japan of the civil wars of the 1860's, rewriting the nameless private eye as an equally nameless wandering samurai (played with exquisite panache by Toshiro Mifuni), while at the same time parodying the typical *chambara* (swordfight film) popular in Japan. I refer of course to ""Yojombo"" (1962). Nonetheless, the the torture sequence is lifted from ""The Glass Key"" and interjected as a pivotal scene in ""Yojimbo"". A couple of subtractions and additions need be noted here: Kurosawa strips the Freudian subtext out of the torture sequence completely, so that the torture becomes a study in the what Hannah Arendt referred to as the ""banality"" of evil"" - the torturers are just doing a job. This fits neatly with the critique of capitalism implicit in the film, and which is equally implicit in the Hammett original, so the loss of Freudian content goes by unnoticed.On the other hand, Kurosawa and Mifune add an earthiness to the nameless hero lacking in Hammett's tension filled original: Mifune's samurai is always scratching, eating, cringing or sneering. Perhaps this is to make up for the subtraction of the element of alcoholism that was the chief weakness of Hammett's anti-hero.

Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera.

In the city , wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice was on a tennis tour . But his plan for pulling off the perfect crime is temporarily foiled and quickly switches to another plan . Meanwhile a Police Inspector (John Williams who won the 1953 Tony Award to recreate his stage role of Chief Inspector Hubbard) investigates the deeds .Top-notch suspense film of a man plotting spouse's killing , full of sustained intrigue , thrills , a few interesting twists and entertainment . The picture , stagy at times , is formed by two parts , a Plan A and a Plan B with even more fun . Casting is frankly magnificent , the stars are excellently cast . Splendid performances from Ray Milland as a rather likable nasty who desires to inherit his wife's fortune and John Williams as an obstinate Inspector who carries out the subsequent investigation .

73,Dial M for Murder,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1686934/,"The hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott ""Dial M for Murder"" has been adapted to the screen several times, including the films made in West Germany and Sweden, as well as a TV movie in 1981 (TV) by Boris Seagal and the film ""A Perfect Murder"" (1998) directed by Andrew Davis with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. ""Dial M for Murder"" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow. Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call ""Dial M for Murder"" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes.",positive,"[['The hit', 'Broadway', 'play', 'Frederick Knott', 'Dial M', 'Murder', 'the screen', 'West Germany', 'Sweden', 'a TV', 'movie', 'TV', 'Boris Seagal', 'the film', 'A Perfect Murder', 'Andrew Davis', 'Michael Douglas', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Viggo Mortensen'], ['Alfred Hitchcock', 'adaptation', 'the master', 'lesser'], ['Dial M', 'Murder', 'Hitchcock', 'first color', 'film', 'Grace Kelly', 'Princess', 'Monaco', 'the prime', 'beauty', 'talent'], ['color', 'the film'], ['Kelly', 'a white morning', 'dress', 'the idyllic scene', 'husband', 'Tony', 'American lover', 'writer', 'Robert Cummings', 'the red dress', 'the viewer', 'the story', 'passion', 'deception', 'betrayal', 'murder'], ['Ray Milland', 'Tony Wendice', 'sympathetic villain', 'the actor', 'talent', 'charm', 'charisma', 'a lot', 'Cary Grant', 'Jimmy Stewart', 'wife', 'cheating', 'a lesson', 'clever murder', 'a sole heir', 'money', 'the family'], ['plan', 'Margot', 'the murderer', 'the table', 'Wendice', 'the phone', 'plan'], ['Wendice', 'a master', 'improvisation', 'a cab', 'a plan', 'B', 'a terrified victim', 'Margot', 'a cold-blooded murderess'], ['shrewd inspector', 'Hubbard', 'John Williams', 'the crucial piece', 'evidence', 'the case.As', 'Hitchcock', 'directing', 'the camera', 'Wendice', 'apartment', 'the film', 'the case', 'adaptation'], ['the same room'], ['Dial M', 'Murder', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'clever', 'witty thriller', 'truly']]","[['hit Broadway play', 'Frederick Knott', 'Dial M', 'Murder', 'screen', 'several times', 'films', 'West Germany', 'Sweden', 'TV movie', 'TV', 'Boris Seagal', 'film', 'Perfect Murder', 'Andrew Davis', 'Michael Douglas', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Viggo Mortensen'], ['Alfred Hitchcock', 'adaptation', 'master', 'lesser efforts'], ['Dial M', 'Murder', 'Hitchcock', 'color film', 'thrillers', 'Grace Kelly', 'Princess of Monaco', 'prime', 'beauty', 'talent'], ['color', 'film'], ['scenes', 'Kelly', 'morning dress', 'idyllic scene', 'husband Tony', 'American lover', 'writer', 'Robert Cummings', 'red dress', 'many words', 'viewer', 'story of passion', 'deception', 'betrayal', 'murder'], ['Ray Milland', 'Tony Wendice', 'sympathetic villain', 'actor with talent', 'charm', 'charisma', 'lot', 'Cary Grant', 'Jimmy Stewart', 'wife cheating', 'decides', 'lesson', 'clever murder', 'sole heir', 'money', 'family'], ['plan', 'works but Margot', 'murderer', 'table', 'Wendice', 'phone', 'plan collapses'], ['Wendice', 'master of improvisation', 'few minutes', 'cab', 'plan B', 'victim Margot', 'cold-blooded murderess'], ['inspector Hubbard', 'John Williams', 'piece of evidence', 'case.As', 'Hitchcock', 'directing', 'camera', 'Wendice', 'apartment', 'film', 'case', 'many plays', 'adaptation'], ['same room', 'hours'], ['Dial M', 'Murder', 'favorite Hitchcock', 'film', 'clever', 'witty thriller', 'interesting twists', 'outstanding performances', 'truly', 'memorable scenes']]"

76,The Handmaiden,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3523023/,"Not the craziest film content wise, that award goes to The Neon Demon, but definitely the craziest film storytelling wise. Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is almost as good as the film that put him on the map, Oldboy, and brings such ferocity and energy that it will be one of the most unforgettable films of 2016. Think of The Handmaiden as The Duke of Burgundy F'd Up Edition. This film is pretty twisted in the most unexpected ways from the cinematography that is very reminiscent of Possession in that it always keeps moving, eroticism that is reminiscent of Blue is the Warmest Color, performances as spellbinding as Carol, and the insanity of Park Chan- Wook as expected. The cinematography is some of the most entrancing of the year. Shots that look like they came out of The Master. It's shots like these that make me wonder how was this even possible? It looks so damn cool!The performances are perfect in sucking you into this world of erotica, selfishness, and trickery. Both female leads were fantastic. Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri are amazing with sharing their sexual tension with the audience watching. It's films like these that are the most memorable. Making you feel how ther characters are feeling. Jung-woo Ha and Jin- woong Jo were great as these sexually and financially repressed men who do the most screwed up things to feel the pleasure they so desire. Nothing wrong with the cast at all. Of course Park Chank-Wook hits it out of the part with directing. How else would this immaculate vision be done without him niche for detail. He always knows exactly what to do to get an emotion out of his audience and I applaud him for that. The only negative is that during the middle briefly the pacing slows down a lot and it became really unbearable because I wanted to know exactly what was going to happen next. Thankfully it doesn't last that long and it's really minor that probably won't affect others viewings. If you have any interest in The Handmaiden or you've just heard about it for the first time I strongly suggest checking this out as soon as it comes out. I'll definitely re watch it when it releases in theaters.

77,The Handmaiden,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3500652/,"This is hands down the most perfect film I have seen so far this year. I gave a score of 5/5 to movies like The Revenant, Spotlight and The Songs We Sang. But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it. Auteur Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is a superb exercise in form, structure and tone. With the latter, Park (Oldboy & Joint Security Area) has achieved something extraordinary. If any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue, the film would have veered off to a different territory. As it is, and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals, I can't pinpoint whether I was watching something real or abstract. I was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and Gothic is working the undercurrents. There are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story. Adapting Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, a Victorian tale awash with all manner of Dickensian motifs, Park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a Hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. It is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. Park's finger hovers over all the buttons, teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. The story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. The structure is Rashomon-esque but Park puts his own stamp on it. The film may be nearly 2.5 hours but I hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. When it ended I couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. The plot is pulsating and it never lets up. There is even an octopus in it! This is definitely the most perfect film I have seen this year.

Relying on child actors is a notoriously shaky endeavour and again the constant whining of the kid and the way it talks, is grating and tiresome. There also seems to be no real connect between the first and second act. The 7 years she previously spent in the room might just as well have been a written premise at the start of the film. With no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the film feels aimless and not well thought-through.3/10",negative,"[['A woman', 'son', 'a garden', ""'room"", 'a man', 'the woman', 'sex', 'slave'], ['The woman', 'a plan', 'the son', 'order', 'help'], ['the plan', 'the aftermath', 'the ordeal', 'the life', 'her.The', 'film'], ['no point', 'the captivity', 'the woman', 'response', 'the situation', 'believable'], ['a garden', 'some suburb', 'underground'], ['The woman', 'every time', 'the captor', 'the room'], ['child', 'shaky endeavour', 'the constant whining', 'the kid', 'the way', 'tiresome'], ['no real connect', 'second act'], ['the room', 'premise', 'the start', 'the film'], ['the film', 'no character', 'the film', 'aimless']]","[['woman', 'son', 'garden', ""'room"", 'man', 'woman', 'sex slave', 'years'], ['woman', 'plan', 'son', 'order', 'help'], ['plan', 'aftermath', 'ordeal', 'life', 'her.The film'], ['point', 'captivity', 'woman', 'response', 'situation believable'], ['garden', 'suburb', 'underground'], ['woman', 'time', 'captor', 'room'], ['child actors', 'shaky endeavour', 'constant whining', 'kid', 'way', 'tiresome'], ['real connect', 'second act'], ['years', 'room', 'premise', 'start', 'film'], ['layers', 'film', 'character', 'film feels aimless']]"
81,Room,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3320680/,"SPOILER: At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film ""ROOM"" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young Jack but how?The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro. This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015. It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families.The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. There are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever. Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating.

84,Gone Girl,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3144276/,"I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of ""whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator."" The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic.

85,Gone Girl,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3169979/,"How on earth is this film attracting so much criticism?! This is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it ""utter tripe"", ""an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense"", ""wish I had missed it"". Are these people serious? Can we no longer appreciate - or even identify - a great film?!Gone Girl is a peerless plot-driven story about a wife who goes missing. Seems pretty ordinary, right? Well it's not. And it doesn't take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this. You start watching and - as you do with any mystery - you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place. But no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year. And it only gets better from there.Gone Girl is a roller-coaster; only you're riding it in the dark. You don't know where the next turn is, you can't see where you're headed, and you have no idea how many more ups and downs you're going to experience before it's all over. It's a film that keeps you guessing and just as you're beginning to (once again) think you've got it all figured out, the game changes and it's all up in the air once more. The diary-exposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly. Many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present, yet Gone Girl - you guessed it - does it just right.This film ranks high in the mystery/thriller genre. It is just as compelling and perplexing as Shutter Island - if not then moreso. And let's not forget: the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife. Not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play Nick and Amy Dunne. By the end of the film I felt so immersed in their story that I found it hard to believe it was just a film. All in all, I for one am thoroughly pleased with Gone Girl. I knew from watching the trailer it would be something I would like, I just never imagined it could thrill me this much.A very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all.",positive,"[['earth', 'this film', 'much criticism'], ['utter tripe', 'an enormous heap', 'illogic', 'nonsense'], [], ['a great film'], ['Gone Girl', 'a peerless plot-driven story', 'a wife'], ['Seems'], [], ['any sane', 'viewer'], ['any mystery', 'an explanation', 'place'], ['the perfect explanation', 'mind', 'overwhelming twist', 'the year'], ['there.Gone', 'Girl', 'a roller-coaster', 'the dark'], ['the next turn', 'no idea'], ['a film', 'the game', 'the air'], ['The diary-exposition', 'format'], ['victim', 'the viewer', 'forth', 'Gone Girl', 'film', 'the mystery/thriller', 'genre'], ['compelling', 'perplexing', 'Shutter Island', 'moreso'], ['the acting'], ['Ben Affleck', 'Rosamund Pike', 'a phenomenal job', 'husband', 'wife'], ['a line', 'place', 'Nick', 'Amy Dunne'], ['the end', 'the film', 'story', 'a film'], ['Gone Girl'], ['the trailer', 'something', 'overwhelming story']]","[['earth', 'film', 'much criticism'], ['films', 'people', 'utter tripe', 'heap of illogic', 'nonsense'], ['people'], ['great film'], ['Gone Girl', 'peerless plot-driven story', 'wife'], ['Seems'], [], ['sane viewer'], ['mystery', 'clues', 'explanation', 'events', 'place'], ['perfect explanation', 'mind', 'overwhelming twist', 'year'], ['there.Gone Girl', 'roller-coaster', 'dark'], ['next turn', 'idea', 'ups and downs'], ['film', 'game changes', 'air'], ['diary-exposition format'], ['Many films', 'victim', 'viewer', 'forth', 'Gone Girl', 'film ranks', 'mystery/thriller genre'], ['compelling', 'perplexing as Shutter Island', 'moreso'], ['acting'], ['Ben Affleck', 'Rosamund Pike', 'phenomenal job', 'roles as husband', 'wife'], ['line', 'place', 'Nick', 'Amy Dunne'], ['end', 'film', 'story', 'film'], ['Gone Girl'], ['trailer', 'something', 'overwhelming story']]"

87,Kahaani,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2578264/,"Leave your bag of popcorn outside the theater. You would honestly not have the time to crunch it as you watch this fantastic film with bated breath. For Kahaani is a ride so thrilling, your mind would be tripping with a million possibilities, even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied, or hanging in the air with anticipation.Kahaani is essentially the story of a heavily pregnant London based Tamil woman's search for her missing Bengali husband in Kolkata, underplayed exuberantly by Vidya Balan. The supporting cast comprises a helpful cop Parambrata, a selfish detective - Siddiqui, an eccentric life insurance agent - Saswata, and a bhadralok Police officer - Khwaraj, and last but not the least, of a 300+ year old city - Kolkata seeped in the throes of celebrating the mother of all festivals - Durga Puja.The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people, places, and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh (also the co writer) whose recent claim to shame - an abysmal Aladdin, or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was.In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support.

88,Prisoners,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2991996/,"Never written a review but Prisoners got my juices flowing – in a bad way.The film is way too long, a lot of unnecessary shots, no real emotion, no saving the cat moment (Blake Snyder) on Hugh Jackman's part and one of the most significant fatal flaws in my mind – absolutely no humour, not a pinch. It's a gritty film (and I get it), but please give me a break! An experienced writer would be able to lighten up the mood and that is a must from time to time.Now, the inconsistencies, silly red herrings and just plain stupidity: Why would the child killer go to confess to a priest when his faith dwindled after his son died and they waged war against God? The priest confirmed that the killer was ""bragging"" – so what is exactly the point of going to the priest? Does not sound like a confession issue to me. Fail Why didn't they get the priest to do a photofit and connect the dots that way? If you kill a man you sure remember at least something of him? Why didn't the maverick detective think about the old Auntie's husband going missing all those years ago and perhaps make some sort of connection? Nah, it's not good for the plot. Fail The same maverick detective-solved-all-the-cases finds everything out by chance – by chance he sees the cable sticking out from behind a cupboard which (surprise, surprise!) is hiding a secret entrance to a secret basement and the priest never even thought of getting rid of the body. Then, by chance again, the maverick detective shoves all the stuff on the floor from his desk and voila! – A clue again! Fail Why did Hugh Jackman's character need to beat the retarded Alex – when the genius detective interviewed him, it seemed the phobia of human touch did the job? Plus, Keller never got anything out of Alex although Alex's capable – when the plot requires – to utter a completely coherent and revealing sentence. Also, everybody would of course believe the retard but not the father trying to find his missing child. Where was surveillance? Oh, my next point – the whole police force consists of the genius detective, his superior with an office, a couple of administrative guys and a forensic team of 2 – get outta here! The genius detective does not only seem to have no training but lacking in common sense as well – why would you not close the first snake box and let the snakes get out whilst you're opening other boxes? This is just idiotic. Fail Everybody seem to be talking in riddles – the girl that escaped utters ""you were there"", everybody seem to hear it, see Keller run out like mad, but for the plot purposes, nobody reacts. Instead of questioning the girl (who, we've just witnessed, can actually speak!), they just stand around in a friendly circle. Fail Keller goes to the auntie's house knowing full well that she's a serial killer and (one in such extreme situation would gather) – very dangerous. He TURNS HIS BACK to her and mutters a threat. For what I know, she could have knocked him out with a frying pan at that point. Fail The evil Auntie, weirdly, seems to be repeating every command twice – open the drawer x 2, get in the car x 2, everything's repeated twice – are the writers short of words? What's going on? Fail Oh, and a note to the director – try cutting the scenes down or eliminate the ones with people just walking down the hospital corridors – may add urgency to the pace and people would not doze off whilst watching a 2.5 hour film the story of which does not warrant this length.The list goes on.

90,Mad Max: Fury Road,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3247360/,"I'm not completely sure what I was expecting from Fury Road, but it was more than this. This is the latest example of Hollywood rehashing a successful and good movie franchise solely for profit. It's mindless, repetitive action sequences melded between horrible acting and overused clichés.One of the allures of this series is seeing the outlandish road vehicles that are used, and in this the movie mostly delivers. You have the high-powered Warrior Rig driven by Furiosa. There's battle vehicles equipped with spikes, rigs with counter-balanced poles for launching warriors into other vehicles, and there's even a vehicle equipped with large bass drums and a stack of speakers that would make KISS jealous with a psychotic guitarist wailing away for our musical enjoyment. And of course, each vehicle comes equipped with more explosive arsenal than a battle ship. And it's put to good use.However, once you get past the eye candy, you realize there's nothing else to it. The story is weak. The characters are weaker. And the acting is the worst. The movie never drew me in. Not even close. Whenever the movie 'tried' to add depth and be dramatic, it was painful and embarrassing to watch. The scene where Furiosa reacts to finding out her birth home is gone by taking off her prosthetic arm and dropping down to her knees may be the worst movie scene I've ever watched. And it says something when the most interesting character is Nux, a relentless slave/warrior who actually has a mind of his own and decides to help Max and Furiosa in their quest. Of course, one of Immortan Joe's wives falls for him, representing one of the many poorly executed clichés this movie is riddled with.I can watch a superficial action movie and enjoy it for what it is, to a point. This one, however, is just generally so poorly executed that it leaves a lot to be desired.

91,Mad Max: Fury Road,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3238584/,"George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes.

92,A Wednesday,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3192820/,"What makes a good movie? I say a good movie should have good acting, good sound production, good camera work, good plot, be well directed and so on. What makes a ""top 250 grade"" movie? Wonderful acting, amazing sound production, astonishing camera work, really unique plot and to be directed by someone who has outstanding talent. And this movie isn't even good. Why? The only thing it has is some kind of a ""message"". Well, having a message is not enough. It doesn't have anything a movie should have. Acting is just awful, especially the fighting scenes. Music sounds out of place and cartoon punching sounds are just ridiculous. Camera work is strange. Plot is average, or slightly above. And i won't even say anything about the director.First of all, this movie looks like a cheap TV drama. And i know it has low budget. But making shots of a cat getting thrown from around the corner or ridiculous fighting scenes with cartoon sounds has nothing to do with money, it's a matter of taste. Those who made the movie just don't have it.Next, CGI. Yes, it does have it. But it would be much better if it didn't. Because showing the audience some strange black silhouettes unnaturally flying out of an explosion doesn't make the movie look more believable, it makes it laughable. Well, CGI costs money. Congratulations to the creators of the movie - they found the worst way to waste it. Because if you don't have enough money to do good special effects, you shouldn't probably do them at all.Also, introducing a superhero-cop character in a movie that is supposed to be an intense moderately realistic thriller with some drama mixed in wasn't such a good idea.So, as a result we have a movie that looks bad, sounds bad and feels bad. However, it's kinda useful - without it i would've never known what a really awful movie actually is. This one makes a great reference.I've never actually written a review before. And what made me do it is the fact that this movie somehow made it to the top 250. Believe me, it doesn't belong there. Just doesn't.

94,Shutter Island,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2211190/,"First, I know many who read this will not take the time to research what I'm saying to see that it is true and further, many won't have the ability to see it even if they did. So, I know this review will be thumbed down by those who don't like the hard truths in life but this movie (or should I say novel by Dennis Lehane) was a nice piece of plagiarism based upon a 1920 silent film called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.The same basic plot exists in both as well as the exact same twist ending. The lead character investigates an insane asylum and tries to put clues together to figure out the mystery surrounding the place but as we near the end, we learn that the lead character isn't there to investigate anything. He's an inmate there who has invented much of what he was investigating as part of his coping mechanism.Shutter Island would have been a good movie if it hadn't ripped off The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari so blatantly.

95,Shutter Island,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3813630/,"Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshal sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity.

96,Elite Squad,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1750290/,"""Tropa de Elite"" isn't merely one more Brazilian film on urban violence; it's a cathartic socio-cultural phenomenon of almost unprecedented proportions in Brazil, the omnipresent theme on TV talk shows, newspapers articles, bars and dinner tables. Prior to its theatrical release this October, ""Tropa"" was seen by an estimated record 11 million people who bought pirate DVD copies or illegally downloaded it on the net (the biggest Brazilian box-office success in the last 25 years was ""2 Filhos de Francisco"" with 5,5 million tickets sold).The reaction is passionately polarized: some call it the best Brazilian movie since ""City of God"" -- a definite influence here, in the cinematography, editing and screenplay structure, with an omniscient narrator and use of mixed chronology -- exposing the endemic corruption of Rio de Janeiro's police force and the ""unorthodox"" methods used by BOPE (the self-called ""incorruptible"" elite squad of Rio's military police force, created in 1978 and inspired by the U.S. SWAT) that include torture and shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi in the ultra-violent, ever-growing drug war in Rio's favelas. Others have publicly attacked it as fascist in its glorification of BOPE, its sadistic depiction of torture and the reductionist, simple-minded vision of the complex issues involving violence/ drugs/police corruption in Rio. Director José Padilha and co-writer Rodrigo Pimentel (a former BOPE captain who left the squad for disagreeing with its praxis) had collaborated in the extraordinary ""Bus 174"", a multi-faceted documentary on Rio's violence. In ""Tropa"", they controversially chose to give us a deliberately biased vision of the problem: from the start we're stuck with one man, the overstressed, rebellious, self-righteous Capt Nascimento (Wagner Moura) in his journey into becoming a psychopathic sadist and hot-blooded killer, who believes drug traffic is caused by the druggie middle-class bourgeoisie (as if the poor didn't do drugs!) and claims the solution is to kill all traffickers. To Nascimento, corruption is abominable; torture isn't.Nascimento is the film's absolute protagonist, narrator, commentator and ""truth-puker"". In his mind, all non-elite policemen are corrupt and incompetent, all charity NGOs in the favelas are cover-up fraudulent enterprises, all college students are useless double-faced potheads, and legal procedures are an inefficient waste of time. He's nearer to the traffickers' violent, revenge-based, lawless ethics than he's ever able to realize.""There's nothing wrong with shooting people if you shoot the right people"", used to say Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry back in the 1970s, and it could well be Capt. Nascimento's motto. He's a vigilante in uniform, in the tradition of the executioners played by Eastwood, Bronson, Stallone and 24 Hours' Jack Bauer; he's the heir to the 1970s' Brazilian military regime know-how on torture. Yet, the film tries hard at ""humanizing"" Nascimento: his wife's pregnant, his marriage falters, he's moved to tears by the suffering of a mother who lost her son in the traffic war, he's in medication for his panic attacks. AND he's trying to save the POPE's life, no less! All the other characters are just rough sketches or caricatures. The one character who might be the classical ""narrator/observer"" (like Buscapé/Rocket in ""City of God"") is the idealist, Foucault-reading aspiring police officer Mathias (though it's hard to believe an aspiring officer could afford to attend Rio's most expensive law school). But Mathias, too, is finally co-opted by the brainwashing ""Full-Metal-Jacket""-like BOPE training that changes him into an amoral beast fueled with rage.Padilha says he wanted to portray Nascimento as a monster, and that audiences who are hailing Nascimento as a ""hero"" and BOPE as a ""model"" institution have caught him by surprise -- oh, really? Padilha is probably being sarcastic, naive or silly: everybody knows movie vigilante cops have been consistently idolized the world over (and co- writer Pimentel has publicly disagreed, stating the ""Tropa"" is clearly pro-BOPE). The graphic, sadistic scenes of torture -- supposedly meant to inspire disgust -- make the delight of a large vigilante-minded part of the audience. And Wagner Moura's extraordinary, scary performance as Nascimento is unsettling: we can't dismiss him as a stupid fascist the way we dismissed inarticulate stiffs like Bronson, Seagal or Stallone. The fact is that there's now a BOPE cult-following, with BOPE's logo (a skull pierced by pistols and knives) reproduced on t-shirts and underwear, BOPE officers being cheered in the streets in their armored ""glory"", and young kids (from all social classes) mimicking the film's ""bag-in-the-head torture"" as a new bullying style. Militarists and pacifists will hardly change sides after the watching the film; militarists will have multiple orgasms and pacifists will cringe in horror. The filmmakers aren't interested in seriously discussing the drug issue (legalization is not even mentioned as an option). Nor in exposing Rio's drug traffic's multi-fingered interconnections, the zillion-dollar, highly organized international business involving farmers, money-washing executives, chemistry labs, gun-runners, bankers, politicians, accountants, lawyers, transport systems, etc. Nor in showing the real victims: the majority of the favela inhabitants, who aren't involved in the drug business but have to live under its rules, mere ""extras"" whose fate (in movies and in real life) is to be used, humiliated, segregated or, worse, wounded/killed by random bullets from BOTH policemen and traffickers. ""Tropa"" is a must-see film, but it's misleading and entrapping: by opting for an ""open"", ""what would YOU do?"" ending (probably influenced by the breathtaking finale of ""Paradise Now""), the filmmakers demands us to take sides about a very, VERY complex issue they've shown us only ONE angle of. ""Tropa"" is cinematically dazzling, but so physically and ideologically nauseating you'll need an antidote -- be sure to also watch the faceted, influential documentary ""Notícias de uma Guerra Particular"" and be aware of many other angles to a terrible reality that plagues not only Rio, but most of Third World's chaotic, no-man's-land, way out-of- control big cities.",negative,"[['Tropa',

That said, the system of government and policing portrayed comes across as so amazingly inept and awful that it's almost like something straight out of a nightmarish sci-fi dystopia.If I had to compare it to other movies, it comes off as a cross between Brazil, Office Space, and Full Metal Jacket.

I personally rated it a 1 because I feel compelled to balance out the absurd over ratings it is getting.What I saw was two men fighting over the same two million dollars. One who is somewhat good and obviously poor and the other who is this maniac psycho killer. Im not even sure its his money, how he knows about it or why he even wants it. None of that was clarified.The good guy is running with the money the bad guy is chasing him the sheriff seems like he is supposed to be chasing them but doesn't really want to and would rather be some sort of hillbilly philosopher about the whole thing.Then the good guy suddenly dies.

I got the DVD of the movie instantly and saw it the very next day I saw ""Zodiac"" and the outcome? I have then decided that no other crime/detective movie can be as goo as this South Korean masterpiece. It is power packed Two and half hour movie with equal amounts of action and emotion.Set in the times of mid 80's, the period in which the military rule imposed strict rules on the civilians, a serial killer raped women and killed them. The movie follows the investigation sequences of the village policeman with the help of the police officer from Seoul. The story deepens as it goes ahead, revealing a whole lot of sub plots, each one telling the complexity of team work and human nature. The last scenes of the movie can set your tear glands to work.The last scene of the movie needs a special mention in which Inspector Park comes to the scene of crime after a long time and a girl approaches him and asks him what he is looking for. And she then tell that a man had been there at that place earlier before (suggestively the Murderer). Inspector Park asks the kid how he looked like and the girl replies, ""He looked Normal"" saying that she goes away and Inspector Park looks at the camera indicating that the killer might be one of the audience watching the movie. This scene by far is the best one I have ever seen on celluloid so far. Kudos to the director Bong Joon Ho for making a crime master piece.Note: Please do not watch this movie if you do not have respect towards cinema made in other languages and also towards other countries culture and also this movie is not for people who always want a villain in the end!.

101,Memories of Murder,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0914379/,"I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect, 2 local detectives, and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). Humorously intense, or intensely humorous, whichever serves you well.The only regret is I saw this one on DVD, while I believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters. Korean movies rarely touch Indonesian theaters.**** out of ****Try to listen the song SAD LETTER in this movie and tell me it's not haunting you.

102,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0774211/,"It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill: Volume 2, get here, A.S.A.P.CMRS gives 'Kill Bill: Volume 1': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)",negative,"[['a movie', 'the world', 'Quentin Tarantino', 'the wait', 'the while'],

However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes, and boy - what a mix he dishes out! With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Cinema rarely gets this exciting.

Although I never saw a Mexican film before (only their moronic love-story series), I felt like I was right there in Mexico city, while watching.

107,The Sixth Sense,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1257205/,"The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. I occasionally hear people say things like the following: ""The 'twist' was so obvious that I figured it out in the first five minutes!"" Some of those people may even be telling the truth. There's no way to know. But there's a lot of condescension in such remarks, an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. At least in my case I have an excuse. When I first saw this film back in early 2000, I knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. I didn't even know what that psychic power was, and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. In short, I had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film, so I was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.Still, to anyone who did figure the secret out quickly, I have this to say: you may be smarter than I am, but that does not make this a bad movie. Hitchcock went to great lengths to keep the ending to ""Psycho"" from leaking out. Many people who watch that film today figure the twist out (probably because it has been imitated in countless thrillers since then), but the film is still a classic that holds up well today. Surprise endings are, ultimately, just clever contrivances, extra layerings on the cake. They do not constitute the difference between a good movie and a bad movie. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise.Nevertheless, there can be no denying that the twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is particularly clever. It's no virtue if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist be logical as that it be surprising. Plenty of thrillers feature twists that are arbitrary, where the plot fails to provide enough hints. Even a clever thriller like ""Fight Club"" requires a bit of a stretch to accept the ending. What makes ""The Sixth Sense"" impressive is that it never cheats by suggesting that earlier scenes were imaginary. Everything we see is real, and only our assumptions fool us. If, however, you weren't fooled, all the better: just because you figure out the magician's trick does not make it a bad trick.Consider what appears to be happening in the film. Willis plays a psychiatrist who has received accolades for helping children with problems. We see a romantic evening with him and his wife at home. Then he gets into an ugly, violent confrontation with a former patient. Willis believes he has failed, and he wants to make amends by helping a new child (Haley Joel Osment) who appears to be having the same problems (and perhaps the same abilities) that his former patient once displayed. But just as he thinks he's making progress with Osment, his marriage seems to be falling apart. His wife isn't talking to him, and is beginning to see another man.However these events may be reinterpreted by what is revealed later, the movie is effective because it works on this basic level. In a key scene, Willis asks Osment what he wants most, and Osment answers, ""I don't want to be scared anymore."" It is not always clear that Osment is really facing a mortal threat. But because the movie establishes that he is undergoing a scary experience, by the time the movie reveals what it is that is frightening him, we have our emotions invested in the character, and the terror is very real to us. This is a step that most horror films neglect, the recognition that the most powerful fear may be the fear of fear itself.When I was a teenager, I assumed that all good horror films had to have an R rating. Even as an adult, I was surprised that a movie as frightening as ""The Sixth Sense"" received only a PG-13. In hindsight, however, most of my favorite horror films, whatever their rating, have relatively little violence. Like all good horror films, ""The Sixth Sense"" allows the suspense to build and does not rely on either excessive violence or cheap scares. The ending adds an additional level of intrigue, but it is not necessary to one's enjoyment during the first viewing.

108,Fargo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1149863/,"Nobody seems to know that Fargo is first and foremost a beautiful and very simple love story about two ordinary rural small town American people and secondly a superbly acted crime murder mayhem movie, probably the best that has ever been filmed. Every character is genuine, believable, and Home, not Hollywood, spun. The suspense rolls in and out like a San Francisco fog. The side shows that are built in are amazing (sheriff's conversation at a bar with old acquaintance - stamp conversations - breakfast makings). The whole film is an American Shakesphere. I actually know frequent moviegoers who have not seen Fargo (and Sling Blade and Shine). I feel a special sorrow for them. Back to Fargo, every time I watch it I don't want it to ever end. I even sometimes find myself wishfully thinking I could move up there, it's a Lake Wobegone, and then the movie would never end.

109,Fargo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0384112/,"""What'd this guy look like anyway?""  ""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.""  ""Uh-huh. In what way?""  ""Just a general way.""  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing  the interview!""  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.

110,Jurassic Park,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0323995/,"I don't know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where ""Jurassic Park"" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a ""Jurassic Park"" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)",negative,"[['this movie'], ['the utter amazement', 'Brachiosaurus', 'eat', 'a tree'], ['year'], ['spine', 'T-Rex', 'terrifying', 'roar'], ['this review.Allan', 'Grant', 'Sam Neil', 'Ellie', 'Laura Dern', 'a rich man', 'John Hammond', 'park', 'a major tour'], ['an island', 'Jurassic Park', 'logos'], ['no idea'], ['The first dinosaur', 'an apearance', 'Brachiosaurus', 'giant apearance', 'the audience'], ['....

111,Jurassic Park,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3332558/,"Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the first installment of the Jurassic Park film series. It is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, with a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film centers on the fictional Isla Nublar, an islet located off Central America's Pacific Coast, near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.Jurassic Park is the second Steven's Spielberg Classic cult Film. A great science fiction/action/adventure film. This film is great edge of your seat action sequences. It has a wonderful cast with wonderful performance of their characters. John Williams music score is excellent the same like is in Indiana Jones films. Beside Raiders of the Lost Ark is the second Best classic movie in the franchise. Jurassic Park (1993) was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects.I love this film to death! It is been 22.years since we got this awesome adventure dinosaurs flick. I know a couple of friends of mine that love this film including me. It is a cult classic film and It has a heart. We have Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing the group, Velociraptors chasing Tim and Lex after they are reaching the visitor center and they are in inside the main kitchen. Dilophosaurus killing Nerdy. We also have Triceratops in it and Brachiosaurus. They are other dinosaurs used in the film: Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus and Alamosaurus they both had a cameo scene in it.The special effects creating the dinosaurs by Stan Winston are FANTASTIC! The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. Stan Winston and his team did a great job animating live Dinosaurs on a screen. Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film, it is definitely my second best childhood film from Steven Spielberg. The first best film would be Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) which I love this film to death. The screen play written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp did a great job and the plot of the film was just awesome.The plot: During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.The crew cast all did a wonderful job of acting. The acting of this film was terrific and believable.Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, a leading paleontologist did a wonderful job portraying his character. He act the character like he was written on his skin. Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist. did a wonderful job like how she cared about an ill Triceratops. I was really surprised how the character cares about an ill dinosaurs that she barely know and she wanted to help him was out stating! Laura Dern for me in this film was a heart and a key watching this film of how a good hearted person she is. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and chaos theorist was really good in his acting and his character. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, InGen's billionaire CEO and the park's creator was awesome playing his character. It is really a shame Richard Attenborough died last year and he isn't with us anymore. Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Lex and Tim did a wonderful job portraying John Hammonds grand children. I didn't know Samuel L. Jackson was in this film I really didn't know that. The whole cast was awesome in here.Music by score by John Williams is fabulous and fantastic I always love this song to death.There is everything in this film I love. How Dr. Grant, Lex and Tim are fighting to survive when they are trapped alone in the park. How tough and strong they are they don't panic and screaming they are fighting to come back save home. Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of raptors inside the main kitchen. In one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire film, the raptors stalk through the dark kitchen, searching for the kids. Eventually, Lex and Tim manage to lure one of the raptors into the freezer and lock it in, but the other raptor chases them out of the kitchen. The scene was the most memorable to me and terrifying. Another terrifying scene is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her, that also scared me a lot. After the power was cut off on the electric fences and the kids with Alan are climbing over the fences and the power is turn back on by Ellie and Ray the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence. The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real.I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!!

112,Blade Runner,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0991996/,"First time I saw this I wasn't impressed. Maybe because I expected more action from a Sci-Fi movie. Then I rented it on VHS, and upon re-watching I figured something out: This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. if I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs).

Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending. What it does add to the movie is the setup of why the atmosphere is like it is (polluted, dark, many 'freaks' around), and the nice question whether the Hero might be a replicant himself.",negative,"[['First time'], ['action', 'a Sci-Fi movie'], ['VHS', 'something'], ['a subtle movie'], ['this one', 'all time', 'the director', 'cut', 'version'], ['The inner monologue', 'thought inspiring', 'no sense'], ['a second chance.The', 'cast'], ['fine job'], ['Rutger Hauer', 'name', 'Falcon', 'a stunning performance'], ['the cast', 'this movie', 'a technical point', 'view'], ['this movie'], ['The atmosphere', 'a lot', 'attention', 'the book', 'dream', 'electric sheep', 'Philip K.

113,Blade Runner,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4059597/,"A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the ""final cut"" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director). It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as ""cyberpunk"", and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere ""eye candy"", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",positive,"[['A feast'], ['Dark', 'uncompromising'], ['musical score', 'Vangelis', 'a hypnotic quality', 'megacity', 'Los Angeles'], ['Ridley Scott', 'adaptation', 'Philip K.

114,Persona,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1114040/,"To quote Colin Mochrie of Whose Line is it Anyway, ""it's CRAP""!!! To put this into perspective, I love foreign films--and I'd rather see them than most Hollywood films. I have seen perhaps as many as two thousand foreign films--and most of the ""must see"" films of directors such as Bergman, Truffaut, De Sica, Kurasawa, Fellini, Bunuel, etc. So, my strong opinion is not without some experience--I am not just some jerk who knocks Bergman's films because they don't have explosions or toga parties!!!! My contention is that SOME of this wonderful directors (or at least some of their films) are incredibly overrated, and are seemingly above criticism. Well, not from me--I love to stir the pot of controversy and call it like I see it. Check out some of my other reviews--I had ADORED some foreign films (such as The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) or directors (Akira Kurasawa) yet been unimpressed by other films (Such as several of Fellini's films--Satyricon and Juliet of the Spirits).So, on to Bergman. My favorite film he made is The Seventh Seal. It wasn't exactly my favorite when I first watched it, but found that the more I thought about it (with its originality and intense performances), the more I was impressed. Scenes from a Marriage, Through a Glass Darkly, Fanny and Alexander and other movies of his were excellent, but not great films, as they had flaws which prevented them getting higher ratings.Persona is the only Bergman film which I gave a really BAD rating. It is hopelessly bleak, choppy (when it purports to be artsy by including repellent seemingly random images in portions of the movie) and silly. The mentally ill central character (Liv Ullmann) does not talk throughout the movie but the dialog is spoken by her nurse (Bibi Andersson)--who increasingly becomes irritated with Ullmann for her silence. I felt much the same way about half way through the film. All this excitement(?) is set in a seaside vacation home. I guess many found it shocking or sophisticated--all I felt was bored and amazed with how unimpressive the film was.So, maybe you should see it for yourself and make your own decision. Maybe all the critics are right and I am just a hopeless crank!

115,Persona,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0094926/,"Ingmar Bergman's mystifying masterpiece, Persona, opens with an image  of light from the lamp of a film projector and then the film running  through the spools. This is followed by a series of images that  includes a spider, a montage from silent comedies, a spike being driven  through a man's hand, and faces in a morgue. The film then cuts to an  enigmatic picture of a young boy watching women's faces appear on a  giant screen directly in front of him. Are these strange images  reminding us that we are only observing a film, not reality?   As Persona begins, Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson), a nurse, is assigned  to care for an actress, Elizabeth Vogler (Liv Ullman) who suddenly  ceases to speak in the middle of a performance of Electra. Alma learns  that there is nothing physically or psychologically wrong with  Elizabeth. She just refuses to communicate verbally. Alma and Elizabeth  retreat to the head physician's summer cottage on a small island to  complete her recuperation. Although Alma is the only one who talks, the  relationship grows and Alma is happy that she has found someone who  will listen to her sympathetically. She begins to share with Elizabeth  some of her most vulnerable moments. A high point in the film is Alma's  detailed description of a sexual encounter she had with two teenage  boys while sunbathing on a beach in the nude. Elizabeth appears to be  an attentive listener who, by facial expression, encourages Alma to  reveal more and more personal details.   Alma, however, is deeply hurt when she opens Elizabeth's unsealed  letter to her doctor. In the letter, Elizabeth reveals how she is using  Alma as a ""study"" and finds her infatuation ""charming"". Feeling  betrayed Alma lashes out in anger, first berating her patient, then  begging for forgiveness. As soon as physical and emotional violence is  depicted, Bergman stops the narrative and repeats images from the  opening sequence, adding a close-up of an eye as if to remind us again  that we are merely prying observers. The relationship of the two women  now becomes a struggle of wills. Alma grows more desperate as Elizabeth  gets stronger and more dominant. Sensing this new power, Elizabeth  seems to transfer her personality to the weaker Alma. Every nuance of  emotion is unforgettably conveyed in the facial expressions of these  two remarkable actresses.   Persona is filled with surreal images and dream sequences in which it  is very difficult to distinguish between illusion and reality. In one  scene, Alma sees Elizabeth entering her room at night, then exiting.  When Alma asks her the next morning if she was in her room, Elizabeth  shakes her head no. We do not know if she is simply not telling the  truth, or the event did not occur. Bergman does not offer help. The  same is true for scenes when Mr. Vogler appears or when Elizabeth looks  at a picture of her son that she tore up at the beginning of the film.  Being left on our own to make sense of these discontinuous elements, we  are forced to discard thinking in traditional linear ways.   I can't say that I fully understood Persona. It may be suggesting that  the persona we assume is merely a mask to cover our fears and  insecurities? It seems that Elizabeth is playing a role as actress,  wife, and mother. She wants to abandon this inauthentic role by  refusing to speak. Alma, on the other hand, acts like a dutiful wife  and supportive nurse, but secretly yearns to be what she perceives  Elizabeth to be: strong, independent, and self-reliant. In a memorable  scene, the faces of the two women are morphed into one composite in a  classic overlapping shot, an image that says to me that underneath the  roles we play, we are all the same.  After successive viewings, however, I realized that Persona's greatness  does not lie in understanding, but in its unbearably intimate and  poetically realized images, magnificently conveyed by cinematographer  Sven Nykvist. The raw power of this film totally drew me in and allowed  me to get in touch with my own feelings of hurt and desperation in  trying to reach people in my own life who cannot or will not respond.  Persona is not just a classic I objectively admired, but a very  powerful personal experience.",positive,"[['Ingmar Bergman', 'masterpiece', 'Persona', 'an image', 'light', 'the lamp', 'a film', 'projector', 'the film'], ['a series', 'a spider', 'a montage', 'a spike', 'a man', 'hand', 'a morgue'], ['The film', 'an enigmatic picture', 'a young boy', 'a giant screen', 'front'], ['Are', 'a film', 'reality'], ['Persona', 'Sister Alma', 'Bibi Andersson', 'a nurse', 'an actress', 'Elizabeth Vogler', 'Liv Ullman', 'the middle', 'a performance', 'Electra'], ['Alma', 'nothing', 'Elizabeth'], [], ['Alma', 'Elizabeth', 'retreat', 'the head', 'physician', 'summer', 'cottage', 'a small island', 'recuperation'], ['Alma', 'the only one', 'the relationship', 'Alma', 'someone'], ['share', 'Elizabeth'], ['A high point', 'the film', 'Alma', 'detailed description', 'a sexual encounter', 'teenage', 'a beach', 'the nude'], ['Elizabeth', 'an attentive listener', 'facial expression', 'Alma'], ['Alma', 'Elizabeth', 'unsealed letter', 'doctor'], ['the letter', 'Elizabeth', 'Alma', 'study', 'infatuation', 'charming'], ['Alma', 'anger', 'patient', 'forgiveness'], ['emotional violence', 'Bergman', 'the opening', 'sequence', 'a close-up', 'an eye'], ['The relationship', 'a struggle'], ['Alma', 'Elizabeth'], ['this new power', 'Elizabeth', 'personality', 'Alma'], ['Every nuance', 'emotion'], ['Persona', 'dream', 'illusion', 'reality'], ['scene', 'Alma', 'Elizabeth', 'room', 'night'], ['Alma', 'the next morning', 'room', 'Elizabeth', 'head'], ['the truth', 'the event'], ['Bergman', 'help'], ['Mr. Vogler', 'Elizabeth', 'a picture', 'son', 'the beginning', 'the film'], ['sense', 'thinking'], ['Persona'], ['the persona', 'a mask'], ['Elizabeth', 'a role', 'actress', 'wife', 'mother'], ['this inauthentic role'], ['Alma', 'the other hand', 'a dutiful wife', 'supportive nurse', 'Elizabeth'], ['a memorable scene', 'composite', 'a classic overlapping', 'shot', 'an image'], ['Persona', 'greatness', 'unbearably intimate', 'Sven Nykvist'], ['The raw power', 'this film', 'touch', 'hurt', 'desperation', 'own life'], ['Persona', 'powerful personal experience']]","[['Ingmar Bergman', 'masterpiece', 'Persona', 'image of light', 'lamp', 'film projector', 'film', 'spools'], ['series of images', 'spider', 'montage', 'silent comedies', 'spike', 'man', 'hand', 'morgue'], ['film', 'enigmatic picture', 'young boy', 'women', 'giant screen', 'front'], ['Are', 'strange images', 'film', 'reality'], ['Persona', 'Sister Alma', 'Bibi Andersson', 'nurse', 'actress', 'Elizabeth Vogler', 'Liv Ullman', 'middle', 'performance of Electra'], ['Alma', 'nothing', 'Elizabeth'], [], ['Alma', 'Elizabeth retreat', 'head physician', 'summer cottage', 'small island', 'recuperation'], ['Alma', 'only one', 'relationship grows', 'Alma', 'someone'], ['share with Elizabeth', 'vulnerable moments'], ['high point', 'film', 'Alma', 'detailed description', 'sexual encounter', 'teenage boys', 'beach', 'nude'], ['Elizabeth', 'attentive listener', 'facial expression', 'Alma', 'personal details'], ['Alma', 'Elizabeth', 'unsealed letter', 'doctor'], ['letter', 'Elizabeth', 'Alma', 'study', 'infatuation', 'charming'], ['Alma', 'anger', 'patient', 'forgiveness'], ['emotional violence', 'Bergman', 'repeats images', 'opening sequence', 'close-up', 'eye', 'observers'], ['relationship', 'women', 'struggle of wills'], ['Alma', 'Elizabeth'], ['new power', 'Elizabeth', 'personality', 'Alma'], ['nuance of emotion', 'facial expressions', 'remarkable actresses'], ['Persona', 'surreal images', 'dream sequences', 'illusion and reality'], ['scene', 'Alma', 'Elizabeth', 'room at night'], ['Alma', 'next morning', 'room', 'Elizabeth', 'head'], ['truth', 'event'], ['Bergman', 'help'], ['scenes', 'Mr. Vogler', 'Elizabeth', 'picture', 'son', 'beginning', 'film'], ['sense', 'discontinuous elements', 'thinking', 'traditional linear ways'], ['Persona'], ['persona', 'mask', 'fears and insecurities'], ['Elizabeth', 'role as actress', 'wife', 'mother'], ['inauthentic role'], ['Alma', 'other hand', 'dutiful wife', 'supportive nurse', 'Elizabeth'], ['memorable scene', 'women', 'composite', 'overlapping shot', 'image', 'roles'], ['successive viewings', 'Persona', 'greatness', 'unbearably intimate', 'images', 'Sven Nykvist'], ['raw power', 'film', 'touch', 'feelings of hurt', 'desperation', 'people', 'own life'], ['Persona', 'powerful personal experience']]"
116,On the Waterfront,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3007628/,"ON THE WATERFRONT is considered to one of the great classics of American cinema . It's easy to see why . It's a story that involves a nobody standing up to a powerful and corrupt organisation and doing the right thing , of one man making a difference . However it's impossible to watch this once you know the background of the director Elia Kazan . A Turkish immigrant to America he started off in theater and along with Lee Strasberg introduced something called "" Method acting "" where the actor gets in to the psychological depths and motivation of their character and effectively becomes that character . Where as previously film stars like Clark Gable , Errol Flynn etc etc were always playing a different shade of themselves a new breed of actors in the 1950s such as James Dean and Marlon Brando brought the method acting style to cinema and the method hit new heights in the late 1960s and 70s with New Hollywood . Perhaps we should be thankful for Kazan ? Maybe but the downside was Kazan was not a nice person at all from a very important moral viewpoint This film features a corrupt union who are fleecing the workers and lining their own pockets . The Waterfront Crime Commission are very interested in bringing down this corrupt union but they have a problem in that no one wants to talk to them and the union are more than happy to arrange accidents for suspected informers such as throwing people off roofs and fearing that former boxer Terry Molloy might snitch on them because they murdered the brother of a girl Molloy is falling in love with decide to put heavy pressure on him . You might like to consider that a couple of years previously Kazan was more than happy to testify in front of The House Of Un-American Activities and named eight former colleagues he knew from the American communist party with these eight people then being blacklisted . In effect he grassed them up and stabbed his friends in the back .With friends like that who needs enemies ? Continually this film screams that informing on "" bad guys "" is all that's needed for good to defeat evil and unfortunately while being a red might not necessarily make you a bad person there does seem to be some sort of moral equivalence of being a murderous gangster and someone suspected of leftist leanings . I mean it doesn't matter what someone has done because if they've done something wrong then they've only got themselves to blame if someone snitches on them isn't that right ? . A snitch is a good thing There's also a large dose of irony . The only character with a moral compass is Father Barry played by Karl Malden . Yeah I mean a Catholic priest makes for a superlative role model . Yeah I'm sure if Father Barry found out about a paedophile ring for example he'd be round the police station right away naming names ? Or maybe not . After the death of a longshoreman who knows too much Father Barry pleads in the name of Jesus for the workers to rise up against their cruel union bosses who are taking the bread from hungry babies and using it to pay for expensive suits .Let's think about this for a tiny second . If the character of Barry wasn't a priest and just an ordinary worker , and who doesn't mention Jesus and pointed out the exploitation the workers were experiencing what sort of person would Barry be ? No doubt a good guy but one with leftist , almost certainly fundamental Marxist leanings , in which case he'd automatically be blacklisted as a filthy red . Oh it's an entirely different ball game now eh comrade ? Yet another example of Americans not getting irony .

117,On the Waterfront,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1868805/,"""On the Waterfront"" is basically the story of one man, Terry Malloy, a young dock worker with a little, and unsuccessful, experience as a boxer but not much intelligence or purpose He wastes his time around the docks, vaguely discontented about his life and revealing a tender trace in his otherwise tough manner as he tends his pigeons caged on the roof of his modest building His brother Charley (Rod Steiger), a suave opportunistic lawyer, works for the local dockers' union, headed by Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the arrogant mob boss Friendly takes affectionate interest in Terry and tries to make things easy for him He also takes advantage of Terry by involving him in the killing of an uncooperative docker Unaware of their murderous intentions, Terry sets the trap for the man who is thrown from a roof top because he allowed himself to be interviewed by a crime investigating commissionTerry's alienation from the crooked union leaders starts when he meets the dead man's sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint), and realizes the grief he has brought into her life She asks his help in bringing the racketeers to justice, as does Father Barry (Karl Malden), a priest of complete goodness and rightness Brando's moral dilemma was superbly drawn in the film He's an ordinary man finding the courage to stand up and be counted As portrayed by Brando he is touchingly believable The rest of the cast is excellent:Cobb is extremely good as the brute fury boss who intimidates the workers into silence, stopping at nothing to maintain his position of power on the docks... Rod Steiger gives his finest performance as the clever and suave opportunistic lawyer who works for the local docker's union...Eva Marie Saint manages to make the blood go through Brando's valves reviving and creating a heart that never existed before...

118,The Wages of Fear,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4178839/,"In a remote South American town, four men are hired by an American oil company to transport two truckloads of nitroglycerin to an oil field, to put out a fire. It's a very hazardous task - the nitroglycerin can explode for the slightest reason, the road is treacherous and the journey is a long one. However, the money is very good and their current situation in the town is rather dire - they will do anything to improve their situation. Great thriller-drama by French director HG Clouzot. Starts slowly and even once the hazardous journey is in progress, it doesn't seem that brilliant. However, Clouzot builds the tension and from a point it is absolutely nail-biting stuff. The scene with the boulder has to be one of the most tense movie scenes I've watched in my life.

119,The Wages of Fear,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190062/,"This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, ""The Duel"", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.",positive,"[['This movie', 'a gritty story', 'an ultra-real style', 'the beauty', 'film'], ['another world', 'a way'], ['The acting', 'Montand', 'Mario', 'jerky', 'Gallic savoir-faire', 'Charles Vanel', 'Jo', 'a type', 'macho', 'the screen'], ['The rest', 'the cast', 'the camp', 'chief', 'Luigi', 'Peter', 'Eyck', 'Bimba', 'Vera Clouzot', 'the midst', 'the hellhole', 'a town', 'all stuck'], ['Clouzot', 'directing', 'anyone', 'tension', 'a few essential scene'], ['wheeze', 'grunt', 'the only comparison', 'Spielberg', 'early gem', 'Duel', 'Clouzot', 'Spielberg'], ['existentialism', 'the starkness', 'dilemma', 'the grim', 'grimy scenery', 'the cinematography', 'a piece'], ['The latter', 'this movie', 'top rank', 'white shooting'], ['the rise', 'rise'], ['tension', 'the film'], ['The final scene', 'ultra-realistic quality', 'own logic'], ['last word', 'anything'], ['The self-conscious mannerism', 'method', 'acting', 'own triumphs', 'the toxic awareness', 'everyone', 'the audience', 'the camera'], ['each actor', 'a celebrity', 'potential artiste', 'conviction', 'life', 'an outcome', 'living', 'rough', 'fame', 'fortune', 'celebrity', 'an artificial corporate star-making incubator']]","[['movie', 'gritty story', 'ultra-real style', 'beauty', 'film', 'stunning effects'], ['world', 'way'], ['acting', 'Montand', 'Mario', 'jerky movements', 'intense impulses', 'Gallic savoir-faire', 'Charles Vanel', 'Jo', 'type of macho', 'screen', 'modern movie-makers'], ['rest', 'cast', 'camp chief', 'Luigi', 'Peter', 'Eyck as Bimba', 'Vera Clouzot', 'midst', 'hellhole', 'town', 'stuck'], ['Clouzot', 'directing', 'anyone', 'tension', 'scene elements'], ['trucks wheeze', 'grunt', 'movies', 'only comparison', 'Spielberg', 'early gem', 'Duel', 'Clouzot', 'automotive cinematics', 'Spielberg'], ['existentialism', 'characters', 'starkness', 'dilemma', 'grim', 'grimy scenery', 'cinematography', 'piece'], ['latter', 'movie', 'top rank', 'white shooting'], ['rise', 'rise'], ['tension', 'film'], ['final scene', 'ultra-realistic quality', 'own logic'], ['last word', 'anything'], ['mannerism of method acting', 'own triumphs', 'awareness of everyone', 'actors', 'audience', 'camera', 'directors'], ['actor', 'celebrity', 'potential artiste', 'conviction that actors', 'life people', 'outcome of living rough', 'imaginative lives', 'fame and fortune', 'celebrity', 'artificial corporate star-making incubator']]"
120,The Third Man,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2517291/,"Let me start this off by saying that on the technical side, The Third Man is absolutely brilliant. The cinematography is beautiful, the visuals enhance the atmosphere, and that soundtrack is perfect. It's beautiful to look at and wonderful to watch.That aside, I don't know how far I can go without sounding like a pretentious idiot or an uninformed idiot. I don't particularly like either and I'd hate to become one too.The Third Man has a fantastic premise. Plenty of great twists and turns with fine performances from Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton, but in my opinion, I don't think that this noir story stands out or is all that great anyway.Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not too keen on several plot holes and inconsistencies. First off, we don't know who the real ""Third Man"" is. Harry Lime? Or someone else? Maybe that's supposed to be the beauty of it and I'm not getting it, but I don't like it at all. Second, the shop owner was killed all of a sudden when he was about to give out information. Harry Lime? Or again, someone else? He's pulled to the side and forgotten about just as soon as he's gone.But my biggest problem with the film is with Anna Schmidt. First off, she claims she is no longer in love with Lime. Then she finds out the atrocities he's committed, and further cements her decision that she is better off living with someone like Holly instead of Lime. In fact, who can't help but dislike Lime for the things he had done? But in the end, she ends up hating everyone around her for setting him up for his death. She won't talk to Holly, she tries to defend him and show him the way out of his problem, she won't cooperate. What gives? And then the ending scene. That entire ending, in fact. The ten minute chase scene, while expertly shot, dragged and didn't need to be ten minutes long. It could've gotten to the point in about three minutes. And the final three minutes of the movie, in which Anna just walks and Holly stupidly waits for him.I don't know.

121,The Third Man,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3370020/,"I don't know why this movie always hooks me the way it does; it's obviously a masterpiece and a revered piece of British/American cinema - but that alone is not the reason (there are other such masterpieces which fail to have that effect on me). Maybe it's the setting: the beautiful city of Vienna right after World War II, the scars of the most devastating conflict in human history still visible at every corner. Or it's the contrast between the eerily happy music tune - which plays throughout the entire film - and the dark, tragic story of murder and betrayal which I find so strangely captivating. Whatever it is, I just love this movie.'The Third Man' now has more than 60 years on its back, but its age hardly shows. Despite the story's dark themes, the general mood of the narrative is rather light, sometimes darkly funny, and the slightly cynical tone and morally ambiguous characters give the movie a very modern feel. What also stands out and makes the film memorable - in addition to the fantastic soundtrack - is the outstanding, Accademy Award winning cinematography. Black and white has rarely looked better. The way DOP Robert Krasker plays with unusual angles and virtually ""paints"" this city of Vienna with light and shadow, he adds an almost expressionistic quality to the film. I always felt that the city plays an essential part in the story, - a key character if you will - with its damaged buildings reflecting the damaged human characters. The recent war is a looming presence throughout the film, and to me this is as much a story about the desensitizing effect of war on people as it is a murder mystery. And there is yet another quality to the film which needs to be mentioned: it's very entertaining. 'The Third Man' has fantastic pacing and there is simply not a dull moment in it. To sum up my overall impressions, this is one of those rare occasions where everything just falls right into place and helps create a unique film experience: Carol Reed's masterful direction and the wonderful performances by the fantastic actors (Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli and Orson Welles); the beautiful soundtrack by Anton Karas; the gorgeous cinematography by Robert Krasker, and, perhaps most importantly, the story and screenplay by Graham Greene with its unexpected twists and turns (although the unusual, iconic ending wasn't Greene's idea).

122,Rebecca,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0022616/,"The only Alfred Hitchcock (Oscar-nominated for directing) film to win the Best Picture Oscar, ""Rebecca"" is one of those typical films from the amazing director that chills, entertains and puts you on the edge of your seat each time you watch it. Joan Fontaine (Oscar-nominated) has just married the very wealthy Laurence Olivier (also Oscar-nominated), but she is haunted by his mysterious housekeeper (a show-stopping Oscar-nominated performance by Judith Anderson) and the memory of the film's titled character (Olivier's late wife). Hitchcock, noted for his subtle sexual under-tones in films spares none of that here as Anderson's character and the late titled character's relationship seemed to go much further than employee-employer. Anderson slowly tries to drive Fontaine to insanity and the end she may accomplish her devious goal. Hitchcock's first real major U.S. debut stunned the Academy and audiences alike and would lead to the coveted Best Picture Oscar.

It's a masterpiece in my opinion, full of suspense, mystery and brooding atmosphere. It's also one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. I've watched it several times over the years, and even now that I know all the plot twists and turns (quite shocking on your first viewing), it never fails to hook me in. One of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. I'm not much of an Olivier fan but he's superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter's new bride. I can't spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can't imagine any other actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in 'Suspicion' with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but 'Rebecca' is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson ('Laura') as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca's slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter's bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy. Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in 'Foreign Correspondent', and Bruce played Cary Grant's lovable pal ""Beaky"" in 'Suspicion'. I sometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too ""old fashioned"", but for me movies like 'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of the lot.

So I expected to calibrate my tv set with it, and to stash it with the other DVDs I never watch.But from the beginning, I was hooked. Why was everything so normal, then imagery became so... astounding? The first minutes of the film were crucial, since I really began to see that these movie was trying so hard to convey a meaning far beyond that of being an expressionist film. So I followed, and followed. And marveled at the weird angles, incredible set design, and at the story that was unfurling on screen. A feeling of nervousness began by the second half of the movie, since (I think) the sets had worked their magic on my imagination, and I was sucked deep into the movie. And when I thought the movie was over.... there was an ending any modern movie would love to achieve. Terrific!Watching the running commentary only made things even better, since every detail and nuisance was explained, tracing paralels with Germany of the 1920's, and exploring the motivation and inner workings of every character.

125,The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0002050/,"Made in 1919, ""The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari"" was literally years ahead of its time and remains a triumphant accomplishment in the genre of German Expressionism. Remembered mainly for its stunning sets, which featured crooked buildings and twisted landscapes, ""Cabinet"" also boasts one of the first attempts at a twist ending, something quite new and shocking for its time.Told mainly from the point of view of Francis, a young man who lives in the small village of Holstenwall, Germany, ""Cabinet"" tells the tale of murder and madness which seems to accompany the arrival of a carnival. Francis and his best friend Alan go to the carnival and are presented with the sideshow attraction Cesare the Somnambulist, a gaunt and hideous young man who spends his life sleeping in a coffin-like cabinet and seems able to predict the future when awake. Cesare (played by a young Conrad Veidt, who later went on to play the evil Nazi general in Casablanca) informs Alan that he will soon die, and indeed, Alan is found murdered the next morning. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange keeper, a man called Caligari. As Francis desperately tries to solve the mystery and find his friends killer, it seems that the beautiful young Jane, beloved by both Alan and Francis, has been targeted as the next victim.This is a genuinely creepy film which delves deep into the mysteries of the abnormal mind...an uncomfortable journey to say the least. Everyone is suspect and, in the end, we must ask ourselves: ""who is really the mad one here?"" Subtle and ingenious, we see the world the way an insane person might see it; warped and confused, a nightmarish terrain where nothing makes sense and balance is not to be found.

127,Baby,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3168639/,"Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.I have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5.",positive,"[['the basis', 'region', 'country', 'this title', 'India', 'proud', 'this movie'], ['either lack', 'thrill', 'Hollywood'], [], ['the lack', 'Bollywood'], ['the movie', 'agenda', 'world', 'i.e', 'Terrorism', 'way'], ['The story', 'the smooth flow', 'script'], ['the hustle', 'front'], ['half', 'the plot', 'the movie', 'the second half', 'the execution'], ['predecessor'], ['Last hour', 'the acting', 'Akshay Kumar', 'a role', 'life'], ['character', 'extra amount', 'thrill', 'superb action'], ['Danny', 'role'], ['Anupam', 'Tapsee', 'Kay Kay', 'act life', 'this movie', 'a combo', 'power', 'performances.Director', 'Neeraj Pandey', 'Wednesday', 'Sp', 'little scope', 'improvement'], ['a notch'], ['Editing'], ['Screenplay', 'the soul', 'this movie', 'BM'], ['Cinematography', 'deserve', 'applause'], ['the movie', 'a lot'], ['Music'], ['Choreography', 'action', 'the fast', 'drama', 'screenplay.Overall', 'ovation', 'Neeraj', 'Akshay', 'a movie', 'proud'], ['Hindi', 'movies.A movie', 'Hollywood', 'standard', 'execution'], ['Akshay', 'a shot', 'dream', 'National Award'], ['along', 'Neeraj Pandey'], ['India', 'Oscar', 'entry', 'next year.I', 'this movie']]","[['movies', 'basis', 'region or country', 'title', 'India', 'proud', 'movie'], ['people', 'social media', 'low standards', 'Indian movies', 'thrillers', 'lack thrill', 'Hollywood'], ['occasions'], ['people', 'lack', 'movies in Bollywood'], ['movie', 'agenda world', 'i.e', 'Terrorism', 'way'], ['story comprises', 'many small incidents', 'flow of script'], ['hustle', 'front'], ['half', 'plot', 'movie', 'second half', 'execution'], ['scenes complements', 'predecessor', 'nails'], ['Last hour', 'actions', 'acting', 'Akshay Kumar', 'role', 'life'], ['character', 'amount of thrill', 'superb action'], ['Danny', 'role'], ['Anupam', 'Tapsee', 'Kay Kay', 'casts', 'act life', 'characters', 'movie', 'combo of power', 'performances.Director Neeraj Pandey', 'Wednesday and Sp', 'thats', 'scope for improvement'], ['i', 'notch', 'masterpieces'], ['Editing'], ['Screenplay', 'soul', 'movie while BM'], ['Cinematography', 'deserve applause'], ['Dialogues', 'movie', 'lot'], ['Music'], ['Choreography', 'action', 'few flaws', 'few scenes', 'fast', 'drama and screenplay.Overall', 'ovation for Neeraj', 'Akshay', 'Indians', 'movie', 'proud'], ['books', 'Hindi', 'movie of Hollywood standard', 'execution'], ['Akshay', 'shot', 'dream', 'National Award'], ['along with Neeraj Pandey'], ['India', 'Oscar entry', 'next year.I', 'movie', 'other Indian movies']]"
128,The Raid 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2978651/,"This sequel is better in every conceivable way. The action might take up a little less screen time percentage wise, but is more brutal (way more), even better choreographed, varied and memorable.

Obviously I haven't seen every movie in existence, but I have never seen anything with such a collection of incredibly well done and brutal fights.

129,The Raid 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2988005/,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) (Indonesian Action).Viewed on March 28th at the Regal E-Walk cinema in the heart of New York City.After surviving the apartment building raid, Iko Uwais goes undercover to take down an Indonesian crime syndicate that is feuding with an invasive Japanese yakuza clan in Jakarta. Things get out of control and everything goes to hell. That's the plot in a nutshell.The fighting is the main draw of this film. Martial arts films are frequently under-appreciated because critics tend to downplay the artistry of orchestrating a fight sequence. In some ways it's like staging a complex dance with extremely difficult performances by physical talents who have spent their entire lives perfecting their craft. In many cases it can be even more challenging than executing a good dramatic moment. With that said, ""The Raid 2"" is an exquisite ballet of death with an incredible variety of expertly crafted action sequences that have a grounded, realistic feel to them. It's hard to describe, but despite the insane action there's very little outrageousness present. The choreography here is some of the best ever put on film.There is no question that Uwais is currently the premiere martial arts star, and there is certainly no question that Gareth Evans is the greatest action director on the planet. This man is a genius in terms of visually expressing action through vivid, mind-blowing camera-work. This guy never directed a car chase sequence in his life, and yet his very first attempt is impressive. I did notice a bit more shaky cam in this film when compared to its predecessor, but one can see everything so it's not a problem. Evans is also a pro to create a crescendo of action where every fight seems to outdo the one before it. This generates an absolutely thrilling final hour that will go down in history.The gory violence of ""The Raid 2"" is a big ""screw you"" to PG-13 action movies. Some critics are already whining about the graphic bloodletting, but these are the same guys who hand out 90% approval ratings to movies with incompetent action and no edge – *cough* ""The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire"" (2013) *cough*. The gore in ""The Raid 2"" isn't just randomly thrown in either. It's a logical consequence of the situation and characters, and it is applied in very creative ways. I have heard that Evans was only coerced to cut a few ""frames"" due to the MPAA review, but I have no idea which frames those were because the now infamous shotgun kill is present in its full, unadulterated glory.The $4.5 million budget is an even bigger ""screw you"" to mega budget Hollywood blockbusters. ""The Raid 2"" has more thrilling action than every $100+ million superhero movie I've ever seen . . . at less than 4.5% of the cost. It's almost unbelievable what these guys can do with a limited budget.Given the exceptional quality of the action, the 148-minute runtime puts some pressure on the story to maintain its momentum between the violence. The first ""Raid"" received much criticism that asserted a generic story and undeveloped characters, but I felt that it nevertheless established a ""feel"" for the characters without the need for long-winded exposition. That ""feel"" can add quite a bit to an action film. ""The Raid 2"" spends more time setting up its premise, which results in some genuine plot and character development. It attempts to do this by taking a generic gangster template and infusing it with a sprawling crime saga that implements many characters. This is essentially a ""chess board"" setup where numerous pieces are first put into place, allowing for many possible confrontations. The viewer is therefore able to relish the moment when a particular piece attacks and takes down another, revealing the actual outcome amidst the countless possibilities. I really liked some of the supporting characters in this, and actually felt a bit sad when they died (even some of the villains!). I am a bit disappointed that both ""Hammer Girl"" and Baseball Bat Man"" are only given a few scenes, but they are certainly memorable. I really liked that brief moment where Hammer Girl picked up her hammers on the bar shelf. It was slightly child-like and innocent, like she was going out to play with friends. This brief, split-second moment can communicate a lot about her character. I suppose it helps to already be a fan of the actors and actresses here, since there are a number of familiar faces from both Indonesian and Japanese film industries. Needless to say, the performances are top notch. The Japanese actors have their little moments, but they could have been given more to do in this. Maybe ""The Raid 3"" will give them more time in the spotlight.Overall, ""The Raid 2"" is a very satisfying action film that justifies its hype after just one viewing.

130,The Imitation Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3138435/,"While it is a moderately decent film on a noble subject matter, I never felt thrilled, moved or otherwise captivated in a way that deserves over the top praise from other reviewers in my humble opinion.I felt that many opportunities to create dramatic tension and stunning photography were thrown away as a result of the insertion of ill-fitting material (black and white footage of Hitler? really?) and poor script and acting (Keira is bland as vanilla I am afraid to say).It wasn't all bad. Translating the challenge of cryptanalysis into film is a challenge which I think was valiantly attempted, though excessively dumbed down.A number of sub-plots are introduced in different time frames, one in Turing's childhood and one after the war. Sadly they fail to deliver any meaningful drama, again as a result of mediocre writing. If anything they are distracting and defuse any tension that might have built up in the scenes that precede them. As such, the editing did feel amateurish. The ending was extremely disappointing: why use lines of text to depict that which can be shown instead? Finally there is a rather out of place scene with a barely disguised and hypocritical feminist agenda. I say that because that particular scene was fictional and never happened in reality, so its existence can only be justified by such an agenda. I refer to the moment Keira Knightly attempts to sit an exam to join Turing's code breakers' team. An incredulous usher, convinced she is present for a job interview as a secretary instead (because the evil patriarchy couldn't possibly contemplate she is as capable as men - see how subtle that was? wow) refuses her entry until our hero Turing intervenes and allows her in. We are also told this female character has a double first in mathematics from Cambridge. If wartime Britain was so sexist, why does she hold such a distinguished degree? And if sexism is so evil, then why fall does the script fall in the trap of using her as an emotional element in the story but glosses over the contribution her brilliant mind made to Turing's efforts? Now THAT my friends, is sexist and the film could have done without this ridiculous and off-topic political manifesto. It was the final nail in the coffin as far as I was concerned.I shall not watch this again, however I do fancy reading a biography of Alan Turing, maybe something the film can take credit for.",negative,"[['decent film', 'a noble subject matter', 'a way', 'the top praise', 'humble opinion.I', 'dramatic tension', 'stunning photography', 'a result', 'the insertion', 'ill-fitting material', 'white footage', 'Hitler'], [], ['poor script', 'acting', 'Keira', 'vanilla', '.It'], ['the challenge', 'cryptanalysis', 'film', 'a challenge', 'down.A number', 'different time', 'childhood', 'the war'], ['any meaningful drama', 'a result', 'mediocre', 'writing'], ['anything', 'any tension'], ['amateurish'], ['text'], ['place', 'scene', 'hypocritical feminist', 'agenda'], ['that particular scene', 'reality', 'existence', 'an agenda'], ['the moment', 'Keira Knightly', 'an exam', 'Turing', 'code', 'team'], ['An incredulous usher', 'a job', 'interview', 'a secretary', 'the evil patriarchy'], ['wow', 'entry', 'hero', 'Turing'], ['this female character', 'Cambridge'], ['Britain', 'degree'], ['sexism', 'fall', 'the script', 'fall', 'the trap', 'an emotional element', 'the story', 'the contribution', 'brilliant mind', 'Turing'], ['the film', 'off-topic political manifesto'], ['the final nail', 'the coffin', 'a biography', 'Alan Turing', 'something', 'the film', 'credit']]","[['decent film', 'noble subject matter', 'way', 'top praise', 'other reviewers', 'humble opinion.I', 'many opportunities', 'dramatic tension', 'stunning photography', 'result', 'insertion', 'ill-fitting material', 'footage of Hitler'], [], ['poor script and acting', 'Keira', 'vanilla', '.It'], ['challenge of cryptanalysis', 'film', 'challenge', 'number of sub-plots', 'time frames', 'childhood', 'war'], ['meaningful drama', 'result of mediocre writing'], ['anything', 'tension', 'scenes'], ['amateurish'], ['lines of text'], ['place scene', 'feminist agenda'], ['particular scene', 'reality', 'existence', 'agenda'], ['moment Keira Knightly', 'exam', 'Turing', 'code breakers', 'team'], ['incredulous usher', 'job interview', 'secretary', 'evil patriarchy', 'men'], ['wow', 'entry', 'hero Turing intervenes'], ['female character', 'mathematics from Cambridge'], ['wartime Britain', 'degree'], ['sexism', 'fall', 'script fall', 'trap', 'emotional element', 'story', 'contribution', 'brilliant mind', 'Turing', 'efforts'], ['friends', 'film', 'off-topic political manifesto'], ['final nail', 'coffin', 'biography of Alan Turing', 'something', 'film', 'credit']]"
131,The Imitation Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3105539/,"Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing.As Cumberbatch says near the start of the film ""are you paying attention"". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told.I went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife.The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life. It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.It has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter.I know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war.In this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case.One of the best films I have seen in a long time.

132,X-Men: Days of Future Past,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3024091/,"I think that pretty much sums up the execs attitude when making this film. Great cast, excellent performances, spot on effects. Too bad the script was dog food. Lets start with the end of Xmen Last stand. Professor Xavier is killed right? Well the post credit scene suggests his consciousness survived. Although, we hear his voice, we don't actually see him (Patrick Stewart) cause it would be a whole new body, yes? Next comes Xmen Origins: Wolverine and First Class, nothing that ties this together. While X3 does close the book, it seems, on Scott and Jean, the fate of Charles Xavier is an unresolved issue. Third film comes in, the Wolverine, and again nothing...except, wait. The return of Magneto and Professor X. Wolverine is as stunned by this as we're supposed to be. But it eludes to the upcoming DoFP. So we open in a dystopian future where, ta da, there's Charles. No explanation or anything. 8 years and 4 films, and they fail to resolve this issue. By the way, that Wolverine end scene was as if that never happened, because DoFP takes place 8-10 years later.I also found it a contrived plot device that time moves in sync, essentially time passes minute by minute in the past for wolverine as it does in the future. Ergo, Logan ages six hours in 1972, he ages six hours in the future (guesstimated at 2022). I would conservatively put Logan's sojourn into the past to be roughly a week. So for one week solid kitty pride is kneeling over him doing the time-phase thing the ENTIRE TIME. I guess she doesn't need to eat, sleep, or poop. Lets also not forget there are a dozen mutants just hanging out all this time. In a world of super sentinels, you'd think they would want to stay mobile, keep moving. I'd like to know, wtf happened to the world to have a future like that, cause I must of blinked and missed it. X3 and the wolverine left the world in a good place for humans and mutants. Then ker-pow, now we use robots from the 70s? Funny, sentinels were never mentioned in the original films, save for a make believe scenario in the danger room in X3. Yet here they are. In fact, in the year 2000, it seemed the world was just waking up to the idea of mutants. Ohhh that's right, apparently as of now NONE OF THOSE FILMS EVER HAPPENED. I guess wolverine never gets his adamantium then. Ohhh wait, how did he have adamantium claws in the future when he lost them in the Wolverine?Xavier suddenly being alive is never explained. The serum he uses to walk again is horribly contrived. It's supposed to explain why we see him walking around in the flashback sequence in X3, as well as the cameo in Origins, but fails. He can walk at the expense of losing his powers. Well, he used them in X3 and Origins. And even so, if the serum later got ""perfected"", why wouldn't he use it all the time then? Furthermore, if the serum repaired his back, it did nothing for what happened to him at the end of this film where the steel beam crushes his legs. While seeing certain characters fully realized (iceman using his ice- slide), the film lost its soul. What made the original films so great where how the characters connected with the audience, the social/moral implications of being ""different"", and the whole judgement, acceptance, and belonging that was such a heavy element to these films has been watered down into movie action schlock. If this film had any real emotional weight, it would of been all those characters in First Class being killed off by the government and the horrible experiments they performed on them. But since this happened off camera and just given a mere mention in this film, the audience is significantly less impacted. ""awww, why they have to go and kill off Banshee?"" vs, ""OMG, you mother ******s, how could you? Avenge him!!!""Although the original films were always set in ""the near future"" there were never any elements that made it seem too futuristic. Like the 3d map in the first film, nothing like that existed but it was easy to see us progressing there. In other words, the world felt very real, grounded, believable. Now, it's 8-10 years after X3, and we got giant lasers, space ships, a re-imagined NYC skyline, etc. Like aliens in an Indiana Jones film, these things felt out of place. Then, we use Sentimels, which is far beyond our current technology and have them first invented in 1972? So before we even have the same technology that brought us Atari and cassette players, we have advance cybernetic hunter/killer robots?

134,Blade Runner 2049,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3824638/,"For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling's character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling's character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let's get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982's Blade Runner. I don't say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it's one of the best films of 2017, and I'll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough.",negative,"[['film', 'Blade Runner', 'a great film'], ['the other hand', 'Blade Runner', 'a casual moviegoer', 'the promotion', 'this film', 'an action-packed thrill', 'ride', 'hour', 'motion', 'picture'], ['this film', 'specific plot', 'this film', 'the price', 'admission'], ['every reason', 'a film', 'fan', 'a movie', 'Blade Runner'], ['this world', 'Ryan Gosling', 'character', 'text', 'the beginning', 'the history', 'that information', 'experience', 'the first film', 'the emotional core'], ['a mission', 'something', 'the overall story', 'Ryan Gosling', 'character', 'the sake', 'this review', 'Rick Deckard'], ['the plot', 'a nutshell', 'the film', 'experience', 'let'], ['anything', 'Blade Runner', 'cinematography'], ['the addition', 'the mind- blowing', 'scenery', 'the entire art', 'department', 'nothing', 'praise', 'this film'], ['Whether', 'experience', 'incredibly', 'nature'], ['the overall film', 'the imagery'], ['anything', 'Rick Deckard', 'Harrison Ford', 'the picture', 'the way', 'sort', 'interconnect', 'opinion'], ['justice', 'a new story', 'the process'], ['performance', 'Ryan Gosling', 'this world', 'a fly', 'the wall'], ['the addition', 'Harrison Ford', 'Ana', 'Armas', 'a role', 'surprise', 'this film'], ['Jared Leto', 'Dave Bautista', 'the story'], ['the end', 'this movie', 'Sci-Fi', 'the world', 'the pleasure', 'the greatness', 'Blade Runner'], ['a theatrical experience', 'some time'], ['a superior film'], ['Blade Runner', 'a lot', 'praise', 'consideration', 'the world', 'every bit'], ['a perfect film'], ['type', 'film', 'this movie']]","[['film fanatics', 'Blade Runner', 'film for people'], ['other hand', 'Blade Runner', 'casual moviegoer', 'promotion', 'film', 'thrill ride', 'hour motion picture'], ['film', 'plot details', 'film', 'price of admission'], ['reason', 'film fan', 'movie', 'Blade Runner'], ['world with Ryan Gosling', 'character', 'text', 'beginning', 'history', 'events', 'information', 'experience', 'first film', 'multiple times', 'emotional core'], ['mission', 'something', 'overall story', 'Ryan Gosling', 'character', 'sake', 'review', 'uncovers mysteries', 'secrets', 'Rick Deckard'], ['plot', 'nutshell', 'specifics', 'film', 'experience', 'let'], ['anything', 'Blade Runner', 'benefits', 'cinematography', 'eyes on in years'], ['addition', 'visual effects', 'blowing scenery', 'art department', 'nothing but praise', 'film'], ['Whether', 'experience', 'visuals', 'incredibly', 'nature'], ['overall film', 'certain scenes', 'imagery', 'audiences members'], ['anything', 'Rick Deckard', 'Harrison Ford', 'picture', 'way', 'films sort', 'interconnect', 'opinion'], ['justice', 'ends that fans', 'new story', 'process'], ['performance by Ryan Gosling', 'world', 'fly', 'wall', 'mysteries'], ['addition of Harrison Ford', 'memorable performances', 'Ana de Armas', 'role', 'surprise', 'film', 'nines'], ['Jared Leto', 'Dave Bautista', 'story'], ['end', 'movie', 'Sci-Fi fans', 'world', 'people', 'sequels', 'pleasure', 'greatness', 'Blade Runner'], ['films', 'sequels', 'theatrical experience', 'time'], ['superior film', 'films'], ['Blade Runner', 'lot of praise', 'awards consideration', 'critics and filmgoers', 'world', 'bit'], ['perfect film', 'certain questions'], ['type of film', 'movie']]"

THE GOOD: Natalie Portman's acting was perfection - definitely an Oscar worthy performance. Mila Kunis's performance was surprising in a good way, it is clear that she stepped out of her comfort zone. The film's musical score was superb. Of course, much of it was taken from 'Swan Lake', but I loved that they were able to incorporate that music throughout the entire film and not just in the ballet scenes. Of course, it was beautifully shot and the plot was riveting - I was drawn in from beginning to end. The audience saw a new side of ballet/ theatre that is not often shown in popular films - the struggle the performer faces in committing to and perfecting a role. The struggle between 'good' vs. 'evil' was presented in a methodical and intriguing way. THE BAD: Many parts of this film felt like it belonged in the horror Genre. Some parts definitely made me jump or cringe (which I was not expecting). The film was also an emotional roller-coaster, which was fine at first, but This 'emotional roller-coaster' sort of dragged on to the point that it almost felt like it was too much.

139,Black Swan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2312827/,"There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival (which I managed to snag a ticket for), and for good reason – it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has toiled for years within a New York ballet company, always pushing herself. The company has fallen under hard times, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company's go-to lead pushed into retirement, Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory.Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. Aronofsky has used what he has learned from making the raw and unflinching The Wrestler and the cerebral horror and incredibly disturbing Requiem for a Dream, and has crafted a film that you will simply not be able to take your eyes off of. He builds up rather slow, but right after that first moment of off-the-rails insanity, he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. One that is not easily able to be classified to any one genre.While you may have read suggestions that Black Swan and The Wrestler are two halves of the same film, make no mistake at looking at it any further beyond the comparison of being about two people toiling within two very different forms of art. Black Swan is never a low budget character piece. It is a film that navigates between being thrilling and horrific at the same time. While the horror elements start to take more prominence in the second half (specifically the rather squeamish elements of body horror, done in a way that would make David Cronenberg proud), the film never lets one completely overtake the other. It manages to maintain this sense of dread, darkness and rather graphic wound/injury infliction throughout.The visuals and editing are the drive of what helps make the film so well done. Contrasting blacks and whites so frequently give the obvious hints of good and evil, innocence and darkness. But Aronofsky likes to throw in hints of ambiguity at every turn, changing the colours for each character depending on the scene, and depending on what they may or may not be doing. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites, always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Adding in the element of reflection, both in others and the self (mostly through mirrors), only helps compound these feelings of ambiguity and confusion. It will consistently keep audiences thinking about what is being shown and what is actually going on. The subtle visual effects and astoundingly well done score only help add to the greatness.Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film's lean running time. When so many films are often far too long and dragged out, this film maintains a sense of momentum that never gets lost at any point. The film's slow points are never dragged out, merely well padded out for the shift from Nina being innocent to adrenaline soaked horror as she descends into the realm of darkness. Rather gracefully, Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin's script to blend Nina's tale with the story of Swan Lake itself, and never loses sight or direction at any instance. This is bravado style filmmaking at its finest, and more than suggests that the brilliant direction in Requiem for a Dream was not a fluke.Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent, sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother, and the sexually depraved fallen angel, inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not ""well"" in the beginning of the film, and as the film progresses, you can practically chart her 180-degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances, and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film, her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman's extraordinary performance. Cassel is amazing as always as the slimy and twisted Thomas. We never really get more than hints at his true intentions, but Cassel makes every moment on-screen simply amazing. Kunis delivers a level of depth I never thought was possible for her. She commands the screen with every new scene, and this performance will easily act as a starmaking role for her. Hershey is even better; practically stealing the screen away from Portman's magnetizing performance. She makes Erica into that monster of a character everyone loves to hate, and brings a level of intensity to every mere moment she appears in. If anyone is even nearly close to equaling Portman's performance, it would be her. Despite only appearing for a few minutes, Winona Ryder is amazing in her role as the former lead ballerina Beth. I just wish she could have chewed up more scenery.Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end, and will not easily leave you. It is a masterpiece of unheralded success, and is easily the best film I saw at TIFF. Watch out for it at Oscar time – it just may steal the show.10/10.",positive,"[['the English language', 'the praise', 'Darren Aronofsky', 'Black Swan'], ['this year', 'Toronto International Film

I ended up loving the movie it was so interesting because, it was about something I had no idea was going on in the world and probably would never have learned about since I am a teenage boy and am not very interested in Diamonds. While watching the film I was just in complete shock the whole time. With in ten minutes of the film a peaceful village is ambushed and massacred by rebels, the director also was not shy about showing the gruesomeness of people being killed. I could not believe the things that were happening in this movie, people were either forced into slavery or murdered. Children were kidnapped and brainwashed. The kids were doing Drugs and murdering people it was really disturbing to see. I could not believe that this stuff was really happening in Africa but the film showed the statistics of the deaths of all the people from mining diamonds and it was all the proof I needed. Asides from all the graphic and disturbing scenes in the movie I loved the story line of a African man Solomon Vandy trying to find his kidnapped son, while Leonardo DiCaprio is more interested in finding the extremely rare and valuable Blood Diamond which Solomon Vandy has hidden in a rebel camp. I also love the transformation of Leonardo DiCaprios character from a selfish only cares about him self to a stand up guy who is willing to give up anything in the end for his new friend Solomon. I also Enjoyed the third main character Jennifer Connolly who is trying to bring light to conflict diamonds to the rest of the world so this madness can finally stop. Overall I loved the film and highly recommend it to any one, aside from the graphic scenes its a great film for anyone over the age of 13, I thought the acting was great and so was the story line and all the imagery used.",negative,"[['this film', 'brother', 'mother'], ['no idea', 'the movie', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'fan'], ['the movie', 'something', 'no idea', 'the world', 'a teenage', 'boy', 'Diamonds'], ['the film', 'complete shock', 'the whole time'], ['the film', 'a peaceful village', 'the director', 'the gruesomeness'], ['this movie', 'slavery'], ['Children'], ['Drugs'], ['this stuff', 'Africa', 'the film', 'the proof'], ['the movie', 'the story', 'line', 'a African man', 'Solomon Vandy', 'kidnapped son', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Blood Diamond', 'Solomon Vandy', 'a rebel', 'camp'], ['the transformation', 'Leonardo DiCaprios', 'character', 'a stand', 'guy', 'anything', 'the end', 'new friend', 'Solomon'], ['the third main character', 'Jennifer Connolly', 'the rest', 'the world', 'this madness'], ['the film', 'a great film', 'anyone', 'the age', 'the acting', 'the story', 'line', 'the imagery']]","[['film in theaters', 'brother and mother'], ['idea', 'movie', 'Leonardo DiCaprio fan'], ['movie', 'something', 'idea', 'world', 'teenage boy', 'Diamonds'], ['film', 'complete shock', 'whole time'], ['ten minutes', 'film', 'peaceful village', 'rebels', 'director', 'gruesomeness of people'], ['things', 'movie', 'people', 'slavery'], ['Children'], ['kids', 'Drugs', 'people'], ['stuff', 'Africa', 'film', 'statistics', 'deaths', 'people', 'diamonds', 'proof'], ['Asides', 'scenes', 'movie', 'story line', 'man Solomon Vandy', 'kidnapped son', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Blood Diamond', 'Solomon Vandy', 'rebel camp'], ['transformation of Leonardo DiCaprios character', 'stand', 'guy', 'anything', 'end', 'friend Solomon'], ['character Jennifer Connolly', 'diamonds', 'rest', 'world', 'madness'], ['film', 'film for anyone', 'age', 'acting', 'story line', 'imagery']]"

It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman.

142,The Bourne Ultimatum,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1799343/,"Not being much of a Matt Damon fan, I rarely look forward to any of his films. There are exceptions, of course, most notably his surprisingly great performance in THE GOOD SHEPHERD. But even within The Good Shepherd, Damon's emotional range isn't challenged, which is why the part was perfect for him considering who he was portraying.Part of that issue spills over into this series where we see a super-spy with little-to-no emotions that might help audiences ""feel"" anything for Jason Bourne. But THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM and its predecessors aren't about character, they're about action, and director Greengrass knows action very well. If you think these stories have ANYTHING to do with character, you are seriously deluded. We never understand the motivations behind any of the prime or secondary characters. This is glaringly obvious when Jason and a CIA ""asset"" sent out to eliminate him battle and, eventually, come to some sort of understanding.But, like I said, these stories aren't character pieces but adrenaline pumping action sequences designed as a thrill ride. And on that level expectations are well-met.Running from city to city, this is basically one long chase scene where the CIA learns that Bourne has resurfaced and several key officers within ""The Agency"" don't want him to discover a covert operation that hearkens back to Bourne's uber-secret beginnings.David Strathairn (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) and Scott Glenn (FREEDOM WRITERS) star as two powerful but ultimately despicable Agency higher-ups who's attempts to snare Jason Bourne are continually foiled by Bourne and someone within their own department.Female leads Joan Allen (THE ICE STORM) and Julia Stiles (THE OMEN, 2006) pull in okay performances; Allen as the sympathetic CIA agent who wants to know why her superiors are so enamored with killing off Jason Bourne, and Stiles as the former love interest who reemerges to initially help Jason but only puts herself in danger and must be saved by Bourne. Although that was a bit confusing (i.e., their relationship history), the rooftop chase through Tangier is flat-out amazing.This is one of those film series' where you need to be in the mood for such things. If you want thoughtful, look elsewhere.

Furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.From the moment that the opening title appeared, I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. However for me, that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense.I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it is genius.

144,Sin City,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2237122/,"Well before I left the theater, the first time I watched Sin City, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies, ever. It's one of the rare movies that I went to the theater to see multiple times, forcefully dragging along any of my friends who hadn't seen it (and the smart ones who already had). It's just that good. It's the best film ever based on comic books or graphic novels, and I doubt that will ever change (until Sin City 2, that is). Robert Rodriguez realized that the source material was basically perfect, all he had to do was get the cinematography and casting right. And he succeeded brilliantly. The nearly frame-for-frame creation of the comic panels works so well, because there's nothing really that could have been added to improve what was on the page. And the sheer amount of great actors and actresses collected here is impressive, to say the least. They embody the characters without overwhelming them.This isn't the perfect movie for everyone, but I don't see how it could disappoint anyone who is familiar with the novels, a fan of Miller's style, or anyone who enjoys a dark, funny, and stylish action movie. I love it from the very first scene to the very last.

145,Sin City,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1043509/,"With Hellboy, Guillermo Del Toro lovingly recreated panels from artist/creator Mike Mignola's comic book stories and brought them to vibrant life, setting a new benchmark for adaptations that respect their source material. With Sin City, however, co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have done more than just recreate the brutal chiaroscuro of Miller's stark post-modern noir artwork, they've captured the essence and the aesthetic of Basin City (as much a character as Marv or Hartigan) and brought its universe and characters to a stunning three-dimensional life. And unlike Hellboy, which suffered from a weak, confusing script, Sin City weaves a Pulp Fiction-esque narrative which snakes through the dark streets and crooked alleyways of this hellish metropolis like a fever dream.In short, Sin City delivers a blistering ballet of bullets and blood, dames and danger at every turn. It's a kinetic masterpiece of pop culture for the new millennium (and a case could be made that this was the movie that CGI was invented for).As a Frank Miller fan for over 25 years, I know his work and I know Sin City  and this Sin City will knock your socks off whether you are a fan or a newcomer to the dark delights of his devilish imagination and brutal style. Exceeding my expectations on all levels, this movie ranks as one of the most enjoyable cinema-going experiences I've had in years.Everything works here. From Rodriguez's cinematography and editing, to the seamless direction (no mean feat when you consider Robert co-directed with Miller and Quentin Tarantino joined the mix as ""Special Guest Director""), to the spot-on casting. The script gives Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro plenty of opportunity to chew the scenery  and they do, especially Rourke, who, despite having his mug buried under a thick layer of gruesome latex, delivers one of the best performances of his career and steals the show as Marv, the giant thug with a broken heart. The ladies hold their own, too. Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and Jaime King are all great in their roles, particularly Dawson as machine gun-wielding Dominatrix/Hooker-Godmother Gail. And kudos to Elijah Wood (proving there is life after Hobbits) and Nick Stahl who deliver contrasting performances as vile villains, the ultra-creepy Kevin and the disgusting Yellow bastard, respectively.Sin City is smart, stylish, sexy and sick. It's also violent and funny. Certainly not a film for the whole family, but for those of us who enjoy our movies rated R, this flick kicks the head and the gut like a mule.Here's hoping Sin City makes a mint, for there are 10,000 stories in the naked (sinful) city, and this is but a handful of them.

146,Casino Royale,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1691947/,"This is NOT a bad movienot by any means. Then why the relatively low rating? Because, it's just NOT Bond, James Bond any more. The production values in this movie are quite highthe storyline is decentand even Daniel Craig, blond hair and all, is respectable as 007 if you like the very dry no-nonsense sort (and, I'm not talking about his shaken or stirred  because he apparently doesn't give a damn this time around). However, this movie didn't even have the decency to rip-off its predecessors. Instead, it's a complete rip-off of the Ludlum ""Bourne"" series (of movies anyway). And, I love the Bourne series by the waybecause it's Bourne and not 007. Now I can't even like 007 because it's unique unto itself and I refuse to like it because it's like Bourne.So I guess we've (they've) finally come to the end of the road as far as James Bond movies go. They've started to remake the old movies which I guess was bound to happen sooner or later (amazing how idea-less Hollywood can be at times). The stories will be much darker and without much in the way of humorjust what the new generation needs. As for Casino Royale (2006), I will not watch it again as there is no joy in doing so and I already know what's going to happen. Once was definitely enough. Give me Casino Royale (1967) any dayat least it is unique unto itself (even though it's not even close to being one of the better Bonds'but as a satire, it's damn entertaining).

148,Kill Bill: Vol. 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0931398/,"In my brief, initial review of 'Kill Bill Vol. 1.' I made the regrettable mistake of dismissing it as exceedingly pleasing yet unsubstantial stylistic masturbation, lacking the profundity and characterizations of Tarantino's previous works. Rarely have I been happier to be proven wrong.What once seemed like somewhat incoherent cinematic recklessness has, after viewing the second part of Mr. Tarantino's saga, revealed itself to be wild, imaginative and brilliant filmmaking. As a whole, 'Kill Bill' is utterly unified (not despite but because of the radical shift in tone), possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema I have ever seen. While part one pays homage to Brian De Palma, Dario Argento and the Shaw Brothers, part two cites, among many others, Jean-Luc Godard, Sergio Leone, and Robert Siodmark.But that's far from all.In his critical essay 'The Cinema of the Cool', Kevin Murphy suggests that Tarantino must move on and grow up to fully realize his potential as a filmmaker. In my opinion, with this piece, he has done so. Those merely seeking the blood-splattered, broken-bone action of Vol. 1 will be severely disappointed by Vol. 2, which is infinitely more thoughtful, pondering the nature of violence, both in cause and effect. While the action in the first installment was great, comic book fun, here it becomes severely unpleasant, cringe inducing, and never without consequence.

150,Infernal Affairs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1824159/,"This is an incredibly sad movie.Its because it is pretty good. Its tight. Its completely coherent. The narrative veers in odd directions just before you expect it to. The pacing is just right for a mainstream picture.What's sad in watching it is knowing Scorceses's remake, something that follows this very closely. People seem to like the fact that its sparkly in terms of the characters. It was almost tolerable for me when I watched it. But seeing how this roots the story, and how Scorcese's blind spot kills him... its enough to make you worry, even cry for the state of cinema.Scorcese's a good man. He loves cinema and the world is far better off for him in it, just on his preservation efforts, and promotion of film as a sort of art. But his curse is that he is locked in an Italian mind. He has only one way of telling a story. In his world, all creation flows from individuals. Those individuals bend the universe. If you understand their motives, you understand how the world works, at least the world you experience in the film.Actors think they love this, because it empowers them. But it also gives them no support, no cosmos in which to exist. They have to carry the entire narrative burden on themselves. That's why you have such colorful characters: thugs and such. And its why you need such extreme and un- nuanced actors, who can only bulldoze through. He's been doing it long enough that he knows how to make it work.But then you see this. Its eight dimensions more full. Yes, it is less loud, less aggressive in terms of personal projection. But it works at such a deeper level that one wonders why we even tolerate Scorcese and his friends. In this film, the filmmaker and writer have created a world, two worlds actually. These two worlds interact, but largely stay statically opposed. As with ordinary noir, a simple soul finds himself caught up in the dynamics of the world he is in, mostly hapless in terms of what happens. He can only respond. How he responds is what makes the narrative.The trick in this story is that there are two worlds, and people from each caught in the other. So the tension between the two worlds can be dramatized as the tension between two men (and their sponsors). Not as bombast, but as human. Honor and survival mean something because there is a context, not just an assertion.In this story, some men don't survive.

151,Infernal Affairs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1211149/,"This movie has been regarded as the cream of Hong Kong gangster and cop movie. And has won 22 awards. But we all know awards don't mean a thing sometimes. The God Father of America cinema ""Martin Scorsese"" himself is making a American version of the movie, titled: Departed. I'm somewhat happy to see that this movie is being recognized and acknowledged by a true master, but distraught to the possibility of disappointment.A little history of Hong Kong film industry, being in somewhat government free state for over 100 years, Hong Kong movie industry proliferated to the state of hysteria. On one hand, everything goes as long as people get what they want for 2 hours worth. On the other hand, lack of political drama has afforded the gangster and cop drama to truly grow and mature.Now back to the movie itself. 3 years ago, when I was still a poor student, I was loitering in the local Chinese video store as usual, looking for something exciting. The owner handed me a VHS copy of this movie, he personally recommended it and said it's new and unique. So I went home and watched it immediately. And then I said in my then dark and dingy apartment for 30 minutes, in utter silence.There was no plot twist, and no surprise ending, no Mr. M Night's heavy handed gimmicks and Hollywood's camera tricks. But from the beginning to the end, for full 2 hours, you can cut the tension with a knife. In the end, you still don't want it to end. The story goes on in your mind, questions, bits and pieces start to put together, characters start to take shape even after the movie ended.In my entire life, I've never seen a movie that there isn't a single excessive frame, until I saw this movie. It has forever changed my expectation on crime drama.The story is genius and simple enough. A mole in police department working against an undercover cop in drug trafficking mafia. They don't know each other's identity, so it is like a invisible tug war between the two competing against each other's wits. I won't reveal too much of it even though like I said, there's no plot twist.It's a fairly popular movie that has generated huge buzz when it came out, and since been talked, compared and still highly regarded as unsurpassed by countless fans worldwide. It has an all star cast in Hong Kong cinema, and of course, the screenplay, the acting, the editing, the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standards.If you are adventurous enough to try even one Hong Kong movie, try this one.",positive,"[['This movie', 'the cream', 'Hong Kong', 'gangster', 'cop movie'], [], ['a thing'], ['God Father', 'America', 'Martin', 'a American version', 'the movie'], ['this movie', 'a true master', 'the possibility', 'disappointment.A little history', 'Hong Kong', 'film', 'industry', 'somewhat government', 'free state', 'Hong Kong', 'movie', 'industry', 'the state', 'hysteria'], ['hand', 'everything'], ['the other hand', 'lack', 'political drama', 'the gangster', 'cop drama', 'the movie'], ['a poor student', 'the local Chinese video', 'store', 'something', 'exciting'], ['The owner', 'VHS', 'copy', 'this movie'], ['home'], ['dark', 'dingy apartment', 'utter', 'silence.There', 'no plot', 'twist', 'no surprise', 'Mr. M Night', 'heavy', 'Hollywood', 'camera'], ['the beginning', 'the end', 'the tension', 'a knife'], ['the end'], ['The story', 'mind', 'shape', 'the movie', 'ended.In', 'entire life', 'a movie', 'a single excessive frame', 'this movie'], ['expectation', 'crime', 'drama.The', 'story'], ['A mole', 'police', 'department', 'an undercover cop', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'mafia'], ['identity', 'a invisible tug war'], ['no plot', 'twist.It', 'popular movie', 'huge buzz'], ['all star', 'cast', 'Hong Kong', 'cinema', 'course', 'the screenplay', 'the acting', 'the editing', 'the camera', 'work', 'overall directing', 'flawless judging', 'all standards.If', 'Hong Kong', 'movie']]","[['movie', 'cream of Hong Kong gangster', 'cop movie'], ['awards'], ['awards', 'thing'], ['God Father', 'America', 'Martin', 'American version', 'movie'], ['movie', 'true master', 'possibility', 'history of Hong Kong film industry', 'somewhat government', 'free state', 'years', 'Hong Kong movie industry', 'state of hysteria'], ['hand', 'everything', 'people', 'hours'], ['other hand', 'lack', 'political drama', 'gangster', 'cop drama', 'movie'], ['years', 'poor student', 'video store', 'something exciting'], ['owner', 'VHS copy', 'movie'], ['home'], ['dark', 'dingy apartment', 'minutes', 'utter silence.There', 'plot twist', 'surprise', 'Mr. M Night', 'heavy', 'gimmicks and Hollywood', 'camera tricks'], ['beginning', 'end', 'hours', 'tension', 'knife'], ['end'], ['story', 'mind', 'questions', 'bits and pieces', 'characters', 'shape', 'movie ended.In', 'entire life', 'movie', 'single excessive frame', 'movie'], ['expectation on crime drama.The story'], ['mole in police department', 'cop in drug trafficking mafia'], ['identity', 'invisible tug war', 'wits'], ['plot twist.It', 'popular movie', 'huge buzz', 'countless fans'], ['star cast', 'Hong Kong cinema', 'course', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'editing', 'camera work', 'overall directing', 'flawless judging', 'standards.If', 'Hong Kong movie']]"
152,Donnie Darko,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0942464/,"My comments here pertain only to the recently-released Director's Cut of this film. I am among those who found the original release to be an amazing film, one that was original, beautiful and thought-provoking. I am sorry to say that the new version falls well short of the original.Most of the deleted scenes that are available on the original DVD have been added into the new version. One of these-Donnie's last scene with his father-works very well, but others fall flat and are not well-integrated into the narrative. While these additions are minor missteps, the addition of a repeated close up of an eye with computer data scrolling by and superimposed on the image is a major error. The images add nothing except cheese and are an anachronistic design element for a movie set in 1988. The movie has nothing to do with computers; computers don't even appear as props, except possibly in the background of a scene in the school office. These images have no place in the film's visual grammar.Kelly has also added in shots of pages from the Philosophy of Time Travel, the book that guides Donnie through his journey. The audience is invited to read about 'the manipulated dead,' 'the living receiver' and the like. Presumably the intent in adding these was to explain more of the theory of the events of the film. Some things, though, are better left unexplained. Putting in the equivalent of Cliff Notes deprives the moviegoer of the joy of trying to figure out the movie. The Director's Cut also shuffles the movie's great 80's soundtrack. Most of the time, these changes are innocuous. *SPOILER ALERT*However, by removing Under the Milky Way from the scene where, on his last night on earth, Donnie descends the stairs with Gretchen after they have make love for the first and last time, Kelly has marred one of the most beautiful moments in the film. I maintain that the original version of this movie is one of the two or three best movies of the last five years.

153,Donnie Darko,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0731800/,"I think the main theme of this film was summed up somewhere in the middle, where Donnie is speaking to  a not-so-helpful self-help guru and says something to the following effect:""Yes, I am scared and I am confused.  But I think you are the f**king antichrist!!!""In the end, _Donnie Darko_ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply.  Donnie himself is a basically sweet-tempered (often courageous) young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation.  His quest for meaning and self-discovery drives him to the fringes of our reality, which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves.  The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed (such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl) or unappreciated (such as Karen, the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.)Of course, this movie far from polarizes its characters (indeed, polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish) and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque: Donnie's parents, who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused; the aforementioned self-helper Jim Cunningham, who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else; and Donnie's sister, struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child.  And then there's Frank.  All I can say here is that nothing can prepare you for or adequately describe Frank.Probably the best thing about this movie, though, is its incredible emotional range.  It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states.  The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist's office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I've ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.Finally, the performances in this film are exquisite.  The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing.  That said, though, this film has a dismal future.  Combine the fact that the large majority of the moviegoing public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane  crashing into a building (this has got to be the very definition of bad timing) and it's pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground.

156,Perfect Blue,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1376216/,"Japanese animation has become a very popular style of animation in Western culture due to the wide range of genres it employs and its many different approaches to storytelling; two elements that immediately set it apart from the common Western style of cartoons that almost always are made for children only. Satoshi Kon's ""Perfect Blue"" quickly became a favorite among western fans of anime because it explored themes rarely seen in western animation; themes that had more in common with the horror genre such as obsessions, murders and suspense.The story revolves around Mima (Junko Iwao), a young singer who is quickly becoming an idol as part of the musical trio ""Cham"". In order to make her career more marketable her managers make her leave the group and join the cast of a famous TV series. However, her new role is considerable different than the cute image she portrayed in ""Cham"", as it requires her to do nude scenes including a rape scene. At the same time she tries to adjust to her new job, someone begins to stalk her and to brutally kill those near her artistic career and Mima begins to wonder if she is really doing the right thing.""Perfect Blue"" is often labeled as a classic of Japanese animation because it presents a way different kind of story to those used to family-oriented animation. In is closer to an Italian Giallo than to a normal cartoon both in thematics and in style. The use of animation as a medium allows director Satoshi Kon to create stylish images of high surrealism as well as powerful images of violence. It is not something young children should watch.Based on a novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, the film offers an interesting and harsh criticism to the ""idol culture"" in Japan, and its exaggerated portrait of an obsessed fan is an extreme, yet hauntingly realist image of insane obsessions. The story has been labeled as ""Hitchcocknian"", but its lack of subtlety in terms of graphic violence and nudity, as well as its high level of surrealism puts it closer to the stylish Italian sub-genre of Giallo.By keeping the story around Mima, Satoshi Kon creates haunting atmospheres of paranoia as Mima feels strange in her new career; while it sacrifices character development of the supporting characters, this approach increases the feeling of isolation and adaptation the story has, making a more effective horror/mystery piece. Like any Giallo, the haunting image of the mysterious stalker is always present, and in ""Perfect Blue"" the mystery and suspense are very well handled making the movie a great work of suspense.The animation is very good, and not as flashy as casual anime fans would assume. The movie's mixture of realism and surrealism works very well with the style of drawing and the camera-work is brilliant. Still, while the plot at times gets a bit predictable to hardcore horror fans, it still holds up and keeps captivating from start to end. The original Japanese voice work is very good, so I would recommend watching it with subtitles instead of dubbed.""Perfect Blue"" seems flawless as motion pictures can go, and the odd choice of using animation as medium (it was originally meant to be a normal live action movie) makes it different than the rest.

157,Perfect Blue,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0554953/,"Perfect Blue is a very strange film.  It's anime, but it's set in circa-1995 modern Tokyo, with a story in which everything could be explained in terms of natural phenomena and present-day technology.  Furthermore, it's a psychological thriller, a genre which probably hasn't ever been done with animation before.  But even if Japan's animators dabbled in this genre more often, Perfect Blue would still be a bizarre film.  It starts off as a fairly conventional thriller about a teen pop singer who may be the target of a stalker, but then the movie goes completely insane, assaulting the viewer with rapid changes of scene, perspective, and context until we simply don't know what to believe anymore.  This is done so subtly and gradually that we become completely trapped in the movie's spell, and we end up just staring at the screen in horror, helpless to stop the nightmarish events from unfolding. Rarely has any movie so effectively conveyed the lunatic terror of a character who has lost touch with reality, and once the movie is over, all you can do is just sit there and try to figure everything out.

158,12 Monkeys,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1024448/,"Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  I especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.The story itself is engaging: one man, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. With such a complex movie, it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess, but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. It marked me a lot: I remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines  almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.There are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. The twist is brilliant, but I prefer this ending for emotional impact. Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr. Railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense, the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.The twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain. Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. It's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.",negative,"[['Terry Gilliam', 'David

159,12 Monkeys,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0373387/,"Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to.  Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed.  As Willis asserts ""It's already happened,"" while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself.  It's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of dementia.Besides this, 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery.  With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters.  The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination.  As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman.   Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist.  She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness.  Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10",positive,"[['Terry Gilliam', 'twisted story', 'a virus', 'a handful', 'the Earth', 'underground', 'the man', 'time', 'information', 'film', 'Bruce Willis', 'performance', 'Monkeys', 'Bruce Willis', 'character', 'time-travel', 'reality', 'actual reality', 'the place', 'the time-traveler'], ['the film', 'the prevention', 'a cataclysmic event', 'this case', 'the release', 'virus'], ['Willis', 'a mental hospital', 'the major dilemma', 'the film', 'a trite', 'overdone', 'plot', 'the world', 'Willis'], ['innovative concept', 'script', 'Gilliam', 'unique brand', 'Monkey', 'storytelling', 'the way', 'the story', 'a bevy', 'different time', 'the past', 'the future', 'a scene', 'Hitchcock', 'Vertigo'], ['the viewer', 'cacophony', 'madness', 'Gilliam', 'a master', 'desolate umbrage', 'shadow', 'Tim Burton', 'despondent scenery', 'imagery'], ['cinematography', 'Gilliam', 'the colorless', 'darkness'], ['help', 'a contrast', 'veering-on-madness characters.Performance-wise', 'Brad Pitt', 'a patented loony', 'off-the-wall performance', 'Oscar', 'nomination'], ['Bruce Willis', 'performance', 'career', 'heroic', 'cardboard', 'hero', 'Cole', 'a simple', 'poignant', 'tragic everyman'], ['Madeline Stowe', 'Willis', 'psychologist'], ['character', 'both wild energy', 'strength', 'the weight', ""a false 'religion""], [""'Gilliam"", 'expert', 'complex handling', 'a routine action/sci-fi film', 'Monkeys', 'a compelling vision', 'futuristic landscape'], ['intricate storyline', 'bravura', 'the entire cast', 'brooding', 'bleak cinematography', 'a masterpiece', 'madness'], ['all time', 'Monkeys', 'a darkly lavish spectacle', 'a film', 'brilliance.10']]","[['Terry Gilliam', 'twisted story', 'virus', 'handful of people', 'Earth', 'underground', 'man', 'time', 'information', 'film', 'Bruce Willis', 'performance', 'Monkeys', 'time-travel sci-fi movies', 'Bruce Willis character', 'effects of time-travel', 'reality', 'actual reality', 'place', 'time-traveler'], ['film', 'things', 'prevention', 'cataclysmic event', 'case', 'release', 'virus'], ['Willis', 'mental hospital', 'major dilemma', 'film trudges', 'trite', 'overdone plot', 'world', 'Willis', 'inner struggle'], ['innovative concept', 'thanks', 'script by Peoples', 'Gilliam', 'brand of dementia.Besides', 'Monkey', 'storytelling', 'opts', 'way', 'story', 'bevy', 'time sequences', 'flashbacks', 'dreams', 'memories', 'past', 'future', 'scene', 'Hitchcock', 'Vertigo'], ['viewer', 'cacophony of madness', 'Gilliam', 'master', 'desolate umbrage and shadow', 'Tim Burton', 'despondent scenery and imagery'], ['cinematography', 'Gilliam', 'colorless surroundings', 'darkness', 'characters'], ['scenes', 'help', 'contrast', 'veering-on-madness characters.Performance-wise', 'Brad Pitt', 'scenes', 'patented loony', 'off-the-wall performance', 'Oscar nomination'], ['Bruce Willis', 'performance', 'career', 'heroic cliches', 'cardboard hero', 'Cole', 'simple', 'poignant', 'tragic everyman'], ['Madeline Stowe', 'Willis', 'psychologist'], ['character', 'wild energy and strength', 'weight', ""false 'religion""], [""'Gilliam"", 'expert', 'complex handling', 'routine action/sci-fi film', 'Monkeys', 'compelling vision', 'futuristic landscape'], ['storyline along with bravura performances', 'entire cast', 'brooding', 'bleak cinematography', 'masterpiece of madness'], ['time', 'Monkeys', 'darkly lavish spectacle', 'film', 'brilliance.10']]"
160,Ghost in the Shell,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2841099/,"Before I start this review, remember I DID watch the subbed version, I did not watch the supposedly inferior English dub with supposedly worse dialogue and voice acting. Right off I get what is good at of the way. The action, as sparse as it was (About 4 violent scenes that last about 2 minutes each max), is amazing. The opening is one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. The anime is incredibly well animated, and the character designs are fantastic.However, the anime has a multitude of problems in its writing. Characters are poorly written, and overly blunt. Ironically, this makes them seem almost robotic. The main character is a great example of this. She has a fitting voice actor choice, but has so poor dialogue it doesn't even matter if she is well voiced or not. It also helps that the lack of emotion in the main character (which is clearly intentional with her character design) would likely be pretty easy to voice act. Many of the scenes drag at far longer then they should, surprising in such a short movie, and fail to convey the philosophical discussion with any kind of subtly. The important scenes that drive the plot however seem to go so fast (and their not action scenes) that its like they made them last and ran out of budget right before beginning them. Then there is the random scenes with the amazing music showing stills of the cyberpunk world. While the music here was awesome, it seems the only reasons for their existence was to A. Extend the anime long enough to be considered a movie and B. Force feed you that this is an ""Artsy"" anime that's trying to be deep and meaningful, something it fails at both.The ending is the worst part in a fairly boring anime. While it ends after an extremely awesome scene, it feels like its has been setting up the anime for an interesting plot twist...only to execute it so badly and explain so little that it feels like that it wasn't even the twist and that actual twist will be reveal in 5-15 minutes...at which point the movie ends. And I am left stunned that this anime was ever considered a masterpiece. Especially since so little actually happened. I could explain the entire plot in three sentences without skimping on details. (Which I don't of course since putting spoilers in a review ruins the point of writing one)The poor writing and pacing of the story, and the way it tries to force feed the philosophical nature of the movie's themes causes the movie to be an utter disappointment and laborious experience. Its like they thought ""We want to make a movie with philosophical themes, but we don't want to write a good story"" causing it to feel like 'Babbies first philosophical movie' instead of 'Interesting and complex cyberpunk movie with philosophical undertones' like it should have been.",negative,"[['this review', 'DID', 'the subbed version', 'English', 'dub', 'dialogue', 'voice', 'acting'], ['the way'], ['The action', 'sparse', 'each max'], ['The opening'], ['The anime', 'the character', 'the anime', 'a multitude', 'writing'], ['blunt'], [], ['The main character', 'a great example'], ['a fitting voice', 'actor', 'choice', 'poor dialogue'], ['the lack', 'emotion', 'the main character', 'character', 'design', 'act'], ['a short movie', 'the philosophical discussion', 'any kind'], ['the plot', 'action', 'budget', 'right'], ['the amazing music', 'the cyberpunk', 'world'], ['the music', 'existence', 'A'], ['the anime', 'a movie', 'B'], ['Force', 'feed', 'Artsy', 'anime', 'something', 'both.The', 'part', 'boring anime'], ['awesome scene', 'the anime', 'an interesting plot', 'twist', 'the twist', 'actual twist', 'the movie'], ['this anime', 'a masterpiece'], [], ['the entire plot'], ['course', 'a review', 'the point', 'The poor writing', 'pacing', 'the story', 'the way', 'the philosophical nature', 'the movie', 'the movie', 'an utter disappointment', 'laborious experience'], ['a movie', 'a good story', 'philosophical movie', 'complex cyberpunk', 'movie']]","[['review', 'DID', 'subbed version', 'English dub', 'dialogue', 'voice acting'], ['way'], ['action', 'sparse', 'violent scenes', 'minutes', 'max'], ['opening', 'scenes'], ['anime', 'character designs', 'anime', 'multitude of problems', 'writing'], ['Characters', 'blunt'], [], ['main character', 'great example'], ['voice actor choice', 'poor dialogue'], ['lack of emotion', 'main character', 'character design', 'act'], ['scenes', 'short movie', 'philosophical discussion', 'kind'], ['important scenes', 'plot', 'action scenes', 'budget right'], ['random scenes', 'amazing music', 'stills', 'cyberpunk world'], ['music', 'only reasons', 'existence', 'A'], ['anime', 'movie and B'], ['Force feed', 'Artsy', 'anime', 'something', 'both.The', 'part', 'boring anime'], ['awesome scene', 'anime', 'plot twist', 'twist', 'actual twist', '5-15 minutes', 'movie'], ['anime', 'masterpiece'], [], ['entire plot', 'sentences', 'details'], ['course', 'spoilers', 'review', 'point', 'poor writing and pacing', 'story', 'way', 'philosophical nature', 'movie', 'themes', 'movie', 'utter disappointment', 'laborious experience'], ['movie', 'philosophical themes', 'good story', ""'Babbies"", 'philosophical movie', 'cyberpunk movie', 'philosophical undertones']]"
161,Ghost in the Shell,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0365905/,"Ghost in the Shell is a visually stunning animated masterpiece. Japanese animation has always been in a class of its own, so I won't even attempt to describe the incredible attention to detail and beautiful imagery in this movie. In this case the animation is merely icing for what is one of the most important works of science fiction in recent years.Every generation has had books and movies that have contributed to our collective understanding of reality. Prior to World War II this included books like Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"" and Huxley's ""Brave New World"", and later Orwell's ""1984"". Today most warnings about the future fall into the category of science fiction. Science fiction began to fill this role when Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001"" warned us of the potential for humanity to create intelligent, even sentient computers that could murder their human creators. ""2001"" envisioned computer intelligence imprisoned in the physical body of a computer. Where ""2001"" left off, Ghost in the Shell begins.Ghost in the Shell tells the story of a future in which a computer program, Project 2501, becomes self-aware and begins a quest to fill basic needs it feels are qualifiers of being alive by controlling computers and people to achieve its ultimate goals. Whereas the HAL-9000 computer was relatively harmless, owing to its confinement in the Odyssey space ship, Project 2501 is a recognition that the global internet could have dire consequences for all of us. By comparison, this new villain is virtually invincible. But is Project 2501 a villain?Most people who have told me that they didn't like this move said that they didn't understand it. Indeed, the story and concepts are very complicated. I have watched it several times and still get new things out of it every time. Roger Ebert called Ghost in the Shell, ""Unusually intelligent and challenging science fiction, aimed at smart audiences"".Ghost in the Shell is full of fascinating dialog, such as this diatribe about the cycle of life and death by Project 2501. ""A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.""Thus Ghost in the Shell goes beyond simply a prediction or warning for the future: it attempts to contribute to our understanding of reality by breaking existence down into biological terms and making us question, along with the characters in the movie, whether or not any of us has a soul. The characters in Ghost in the Shell are unusually deep and are a refreshing change from the one-dimensional stereotypes we've become numbed by in modern media. Ghost in the Shell would be required reading in many high school and university courses if it weren't for the fortuitous fact that it can be enjoyed in this beautifully animated feature film. This is one of the few movies ever made that everyone should watch at least once.",positive,"[['Ghost', 'Shell', 'stunning animated masterpiece'], ['Japanese animation', 'a class', 'the incredible attention', 'beautiful imagery', 'this movie'], ['this case', 'the animation', 'science', 'fiction', 'recent years.Every', 'generation', 'collective understanding', 'reality'], ['World War II', 'Yevgeny Zamyatin', 'Huxley', 'Brave New World', 'Orwell'], ['Today', 'the future', 'fall', 'the category', 'science', 'fiction'], ['Science', 'fiction', 'this role', 'Arthur C.

162,JFK,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2401580/,"This is an Oliver Stone film which delves into the tumultuous intricacies of the entire JFK assassination issue! Kennedy was a controversial president from the offset, primarily for the reason that he was stigmatized by many Americans because of his religion. Besides the problem which many voters perceived about Kennedy's Catholicism, a great deal of Americans were skeptical regarding Kennedy's election campaign tactics. Many citizens felt as though he orchestrated some scandalous chicanery in Chicago in the process of winning the 1960 election. All throughout his presidency, Kennedy was subjected to a ubiquitous and disdainful criticism from all sides of the political arena! Kennedy's nefarious presidency included alleged sexual indiscretions with many women, including prominent stars such as: Marilyn Monroe and Gene Tierney! The most intriguing angle which director, Oliver Stone, focused on, was the aspect of the depraved culture dissemination which prevailed in the United States during the Kennedy administration's reign. Kennedy's assassination led people to believe that our government was motivated by hate and fear, and not egalitarian democracy. Kevin Costner played a district attorney from New Orleans, Jim Garrison, someone who became ideologically wounded when he heard about Kennedy's assassination! His wife (Sissy Spacek) perpetually misunderstood Garrison (Kevin Costner) concerning his vehement pursuit to unravel a conspiracy theory relating to the whole gruesome Kennedy assassination incident! Conjecture which arose from the Warren Report, particularly with regards to the ""Magic Bullet Theory"", became a cumbersome and ambiguous documented fiasco which invoked a hasty dismissal to this entire affair. Dallas was fast and furiously becoming a city which embraced a bevy of secret service men who were in quest of evidence which pointed to potential political espionage that could be linked to the assassination of John F. Kennedy! The invidious aura to Dallas, back in 1963, made the city precariously conducive to being a venue that would get involved in a malignant nationwide political scandal! What the film ""JFK"" ultimately purported was not just that the assassination of a United States' President was a conspiracy, rather, this film wished to reiterate how deep rooted this covertly heinous conspiracy actually was! The CIA was now a corrupt arm of the law that became responsible for an egregious subornation by appointed officials to catalyst a nationally unprecedented form of deceit and collusion! The diatribes which Jim Garrison elaborated on, established a callous dichotomy between political temerity with the CIA, and an ideologically emblematic badge of justice with the American people. The scapegoat who expedited the JFK assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, was believed to be a spawn of Fidel Castro's Communist insurgency. When Jack Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, this merely fortified the concept that a politically volatile conspiracy was the culprit to this infamous string of murders. Rumination of this entire matter, allowed director, Oliver Stone, to engage in an acute portrayal of the disconcerting vindictiveness which was prevalent in America's boll weevil culture. All three movies; ""Natural Born Killers"" ""Talk Radio"" as well as ""JFK"" were Oliver Stone films which depicted the numerous demented mannerisms that are indicative of many reprobates in the Dixie region of this country. This is not to say that the South is any worse than any other area of the United States. It is simply to point out that they possess a certain style of belligerence which correlates to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. ""JFK"" did not win for best picture in 1991. The year, 1991, was a year in which ""Silence of the Lambs"" swept everything at the Academy Awards Oscars Ceremony! ""JFK"" was an intellectual film which possessed an alert articulation with the American people that their nation witnessed a pejorative, yet mandatory, transformation in their social pattern of behavior when John F. Kennedy was shot! This necessitated a revolutionary counter culture mindset that erupted virtually overnight! In 1963, much of the United States bore a solid resemblance to the 1950's. JFK's assassination evoked a concise revelation to the emerging and indelible culture of the 1960's almost instantaneously, and, with a very intrepid disposition as well. The whole Kennedy assassination affair brought on a neon accented metamorphosis to the American people that U.S. public officials were indeed, extremely sordid, and, that they were anything, but, squeaky clean paragons of virtue! The acting ability in this film is amazing! The list goes on: Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Tommie Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ed Asner, and so many others! ""JFK"" is a lengthy film because it is filled with poignantly detailed dialog, not because it is hindered with a tedium of verbosity! This movie is one of Oliver Stone's greatest, and the wry authenticity to this film makes it one of the finest in the history of the silver screen! Without question, it is a 1990's classic!

163,JFK,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0295546/,"Oliver Stone's epic film which follows the real-life events of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is a monumental movie event.  It should have been named the Best Picture of 1991 instead of The Silence of the Lambs.Everything about this film is perfect and it shows that when an intriguing story comes together with all other elements of filmmaking that are executed brilliantly, the film works on so many levels.First off, Stone's direction is as good as it gets.  He has an incredible passion for the subject, knowledge of the art and relationship with the camera.  All of his footage goes together seamlessly and makes the 3 h 08 min running time blow by.  He gets a strong performance out of the entire ensemble cast especially Costner, Jones, Oldman, and Pesci.Scalia and Hutsching's editing is a work of art and tells the complicated story with incredible precision.  Richardson's cinematography lights up the screen in both colour and black and white.  Both of these technical aspects of filmmaking are molded into sheer artistry by these three men who have all deserved their Oscars for this film.John Williams' score is one of his best (right up there with his Indiana Jones and Star Wars).  The script is intelligent, thought-provoking, mesmorizing and heart-wrenching.  Costner's closing speech to the Jury is finer that Nicholson's in A Few Good Men, McConaughey's in A Time to Kill and Jackson's in Pulp Fiction.  It is Stone and Sklar's best work.The subject matter is incredibly controverial and subjective but Stone's delivers it with such emotion and raw power that his alternate myth to the Warren Report seems factual.  The film is an investigation into the human spirit and how the vigour and dedication of one man and his team of associates can rise above the highest powers of the world and encode a message into the minds and hearts of millions.  John F. Kennedy has countless achievements and qualities as a president which makes his life and term one of the most incredible and worthy of deep study.Oliver Stone's JFK should go down in film history as one of the most important American films ever produced.

164,Akira,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1244983/,"I was probably around 8, when I first saw Akira. It was my step dad who asked me if I was interested in watching this Japanese cartoon. I expected something like, my favorite children movies like The Lion King or The Land before Time.Akira however, was something else. At the time I was to young to understand English, since it was a second language for me. But I remember what kind of an affect it had on me. It was brutal, it was hard, it was edgy. The drums and Neo Tokyo lights flew through my little body as butter, as I witnessed death, gore and sadistic killings. Something my pure and innocent eyes had never seen before. And yet I was strangely excited. I was never tough as a kid. I was a afraid of the dark and often had nightmares about all kinds of things. But Akira, despite it's mature nature, just had me in awe. When I finally re-saw it many years later, when I was an old teenager, I was still in awe.Akira is simply a wonderful and entertaining sci-fi movie. It was what introduced me to anime, and innovation in a hole new way. If you want to start watching anime or see, what all the fuss is about, then Akira is a good place to start. Even though it's over 17 years old today, it is still a fantastic and visually stunning animation. Even if you don't appreciate animation you owe it to yourself, to check it out.

166,All the President's Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2042160/,"On June 17th, 1972 a security guard (Frank Willis) discovered a small piece of tape covering the latch on the basement door of the Headquarters of the National Democratic Committee in Florida. Calling for the police, they quickly arrested five well dressed burglars, one with $800 in his wallet. What few people knew was that these individuals would become the foundation of a massive conspiracy which involved the entire Federal community including the F.B.I, C.I.A. and other agencies working for the President of the United States. Attending the burglars at their court arraignment, rookie reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) is astounded to learn one of the burglar's previously worked for the C.I.A. in the White House. The senior reporter who is later paired with him is 14 year veteran Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman). What transpires in the next three years will illuminate the secret illegal activities, covert operations and deep paranoia of the Nixon Administration. In this movie, audiences are privy to the workings of The Washington Post and the enormous efforts of these two Pulitzer Prize winning journalists. Jack Warden plays Harry M. Rosenfeld the Metroploitan editor who despite his own doubts believes in the future of the promising investigative journalists. Martin Balsam is Howard Simons and Jason Robards plays stanch Ben Bradlee, the Executive Editor of the Post. Even though they realized the risks involved, they stood their ground and allow the citizens of America to see the importance of a free press. In retrospect, America also learns of the immense risk and hazardous undertaking assumed by Woodward's 'invisible' source by the then Assistant Director of the F.B.I. 'Mark Felt' who has come to be known as ""Deep Throat."" (Hal Holbrook) With his invaluable help, Americas' press reveals how even a man so powerful as a sitting President must not be allowed to believe he is above the law. The film is a great example and tribute to men of the Forth Estate. Today it stands as a Classic movie in it's own right. ****",negative,"[['June', 'a security', 'guard', 'Frank Willis', 'a small piece', 'tape', 'the latch', 'the basement door', 'Headquarters', 'National Democratic Committee', 'Florida'], ['the police', 'wallet'], ['the foundation', 'a massive conspiracy', 'Federal', 'community', 'F.B.I', 'C.I.A'], ['President', 'United'], ['court', 'arraignment', 'rookie', 'reporter', 'Bob Woodward', 'Robert Redford', 'the burglar', 'C.I.A'], ['White House'], ['The senior reporter', 'year', 'veteran', 'Carl Bernstein', 'Dustin Hoffman'], ['deep paranoia', 'Nixon Administration'], ['this movie', 'Washington Post', 'Pulitzer'], ['Jack Warden', 'Harry M.

168,Jaws,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0142135/,"The film opens with a shot of a group of teenagers enjoying a campfire out on Amity beach... A couple leaves the group for a midnight swim... The silhouette of a woman is seen in full flight toward the sea... Her dress, bra, and panties fly toward her drunk admirer who can't make a fist to catch them... In a delicate splash, Chrissie goes swimming in the cold ocean, drawing herself into deeper water... When a wave of pressure lifts her up and eases her down, her face begins to show a certain fear... Her eyes go to the beach where her friend, too drunk to stand, is struggling with his shoe...Chrissie turns and starts for shore... But her expression freezes... Something terrible is hurting her underneath... She struggles with all her forces, but she is soon submerged in a horrifying scene... Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) reacts quickly to the news of shark attack, and emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint and brushes to close every beach on the island... But as Amity is a beautiful summer resort with clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches... Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) tries with his town officials to convince the insecure police chief to file the incident as a 'boating accident.' Brody reluctantly agrees, but later regrets his decision after few more fatal incidents... The shark has claimed Amity Island as his territory...Quint (Robert Shaw), an eccentric old shark killer, offers to kill the menacing Great White Shark for ten thousand dollars... Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), an arrogant young oceanographer, proves that the giant shark that killed Christine Watkins is still on the loose... 'They caught a shark. Not the shark,' he determines... and predicts future outbursts of attack activity in the area...Brody, Quint and Hooper become allied in a life-and-death hunt... They go after the monstrous creature with rifles and poison pistols... They try to tire him, slowing him down with coiled ropes and barrels... They fight him with everything, harpoons, poles, gaffs and compressed air tanks...Shaw is absolutely convincing as the colorful master fisherman whose obsession for destroying sharks was triggered by an actual incident in World War II... Scheider is quiet likable as the dedicated family man who doesn't even like the water, swimming or boating... His line to Quint ('You're going to need a bigger boat."") suggests a specific cause...Dreyfuss manages to humanize the picture while stealing it... Spielberg alarms us with unexpected twists, and heart-stopping scenes wonderfully engaging... His grasp for sustaining the feeling of terror comes not only from what we see, but from what we're afraid we're going to see...

171,Dog Day Afternoon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1089114/,"I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: 1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. 3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. 4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! 7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. 8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. 9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. 10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",positive,"[['this film', 'the third time', 'last night'], ['a straight review', 'the top', 'head', 'this exquisite movie', 'this film', 'perception', 'the bank', 'heist', 'genre', 'use of.2', 'The source', 'this film', 'paradoxical and/or', 'spring', 'life', 'film'], ['life', 'any form', 'fiction'], ['that point', 'this film', 'concept'], ['tone', 'relation', 'the homosexual theme', 'time'], ['fact', 'OUR', 'time', 'an issue', 'IS'], ['the climate', 'a manner', 'authentic feel', 'forever.5', 'Lumet', 'film', 'life', 'the concept', 'an outlaw', 'a hero', 'efficiency', 'Oliver Stone', 'brash', 'Natural Born Killers.6', 'this film', 'Al Pacino', 'the legendary status'], ['* *', 'SPOILERS * *', 'Just', 'the bonnet', 'a car', 'a word', 'soul', 'every frame', 'the end', 'the movie'], ['this film', 'a BIG DEAL', 'real life', 'much use', 'gun', 'fire', 'contrived way'], ['that tension', 'a shot', 'OR', 'Tarantino', 'the way'], ['No genre', 'this amount', 'freshness', 'inspiration', 'talent'], ['Dog Day Afternoon', 'the third time', 'the same amount', 'wonder', 'the power', 'unobtrusive film-making', 'first time', 'round']]","[['film', 'third time', 'few years', 'last night'], ['straight review', 'ten thoughts', 'top', 'head', 'exquisite movie', 'film', 'perception', 'bank heist genre', 'contrived cinematic conventions', 'films', 'use of.2', 'source', 'film', 'paradoxical and/or', 'elements spring', 'life', 'film', 'pre-existing cinematic conventions'], ['absurdities of life', 'form of fiction'], ['point', 'film', 'concept'], ['tone in relation', 'homosexual theme', 'time'], ['fact', 'OUR time', 'issue', 'IS'], ['climate', '70s', 'manner', 'feel forever.5', 'Lumet', 'film', 'life', 'concept', 'lens', 'media', 'different groups', 'different agendas', 'outlaw', 'hero', 'efficiency than Oliver Stone', 'brash', 'Natural Born Killers.6', 'film', 'generations', 'Al Pacino', 'legendary status', 'performances', 'years'], ['* SPOILERS * *', 'Just', 'last ten minutes', 'bonnet', 'car', 'word', 'volumes', 'eyes', 'soul', 'frame', 'end', 'movie', 'eyes'], ['film', 'BIG DEAL', 'real life', 'other films', 'use of gun fire', 'contrived way'], ['tension', 'guns', 'shot OR', 'Tarantino', 'notes', 'way'], ['genre', 'many times', 'amount of freshness', 'inspiration and talent'], ['Dog Day Afternoon', 'third time', 'amount of wonder', 'power', 'unobtrusive film-making', 'time round']]"
172,Anatomy of a Murder,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0971494/,"As a courtroom drama, ""Anatomy of a Murder"" would be hard to surpass. It is a first-class production with an interesting and unpredictable story plus a strong cast. It works admirably, both as a story and as a portrayal of the workings of the law. It avoids the labored dramatics and contrived resolutions in which so many movies of the genre indulge, and it also declines to shy away from pointing out the more ill-conceived features of the legal system.From his first scene, James Stewart pulls the viewer right into the world of lawyer Paul Biegler. It takes little time before you come to know him and to get a pretty good idea of what his life is like. His scenes with Arthur O'Connell work well in rounding out the picture. The two are neither heroic nor brilliant, but simply sympathetic and believable.Into Biegler's world then come the characters played by Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick, a married couple with more than their share of faults. By making them less than ideal clients, the movie takes a chance on losing the audience's sympathy, but it adds credibility and complexity to the story. Both roles are played well - again, it seems as if you know a lot more about them than is specifically stated.When George C. Scott enters the picture, he adds yet another dimension. His character arrives at just the right time to complicate the plot, and his legal skirmishing with Stewart makes some dry material come to life in an interesting way. Eve Arden also has some good moments, and her character is used in just the right amount to add some amusement without causing a distraction from the main story. It's also interesting to see Joseph Welch as the judge, and his portrayal works well enough.Otto Preminger holds everything together nicely, with the right amount of detail and a pace that keeps the story moving steadily. The result is a very nice contrast to the many run-of-the mill legal/courtroom movies that present such an idealized view of the justice system. It maintains a careful balance, making clear the flaws and unpleasant realities of the system, yet never taking cheap shots either. And it's also an interesting and involved story, one of the most carefully-crafted of its kind.",negative,"[['a courtroom', 'drama', 'Anatomy', 'a Murder'], ['a first-class production', 'unpredictable story', 'a strong cast'], ['a story', 'a portrayal', 'the law'], ['the genre', 'indulge', 'the legal system.From', 'first scene', 'James Stewart', 'the viewer', 'the world', 'lawyer', 'Paul Biegler'], ['little time', 'good idea', 'life'], [""Arthur O'Connell"", 'work', 'the picture'], ['Biegler', 'world', 'Ben Gazzara', 'Lee Remick', 'a married couple', 'share'], ['the movie', 'a chance', 'the audience', 'sympathy', 'credibility', 'complexity', 'the story'], ['a lot', 'George C.

173,Anatomy of a Murder,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066364/,"Based on the famous Traver novel, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is an extremely complex film that defeats easy definition. In some respects it is a social document of the era in which it was made; primarily, however, it is a detailed portrait of the law at work and the mechanizations and motivations of the individuals involved in a seemingly straight-forward case. In the process it raises certain ethical issues re attorney behavior and the lengths to which an attorney might go to win a case.Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is a small-town lawyer who has recently lost a re-election for the position of District Attorney and who is down on his luck--when a headline-making case involving assault, alleged rape, and murder drops into his lap. As the case evolves, there is no question about the identity of the killer. But a smart lawyer might be able to get him off just the same and redeem his own career in the process, and with the aid of an old friend (Arthur O'Connell) and his formidable secretary (Eve Arden), Biegler sets out to do precisely that. Opposing him in the courtroom is Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a high powered prosecutor who is equally determined to get a conviction... and who is no more adverse to coaching a witness than Biegler himself. The two square off in a constantly shifting battle for the jury, a battle that often consists of underhanded tactics on both sides.The performances are impressive, with James Stewart ideally cast as the attorney for the defense, Ben Gazzara as his unsavory client, and a truly brilliant Lee Remick as the sexy and disreputable wife who screams rape where just possibly none occurred; O'Connell, Arden, and Scott also offer superior performances. The script is sharp, cool, and meticulous, the direction and cinematography both effective and completely unobtrusive, and the famous jazz score adds quite a bit to the film as a whole.Although we can't help rooting for Stewart, as the film progresses it seems more and more likely that Remick is lying through her teeth and Gazzara is as guilty as sin--but the film balances its elements in such a way as to achieve a disturbing ambiguity that continues right through to the end. If you expect a courtroom thriller with sudden revelations and twists you'll likely be disappointed in ANATOMY OF A MURDER, but if you want a thought-provoking take on the law you'd be hard pressed to find one better.

The Mexican Chief of Narcotics Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston) is spending honeymoon with his American wife Susan Vargas (Janet Leigh) in the border town and will testify in the case of the drug dealer Grandi that is arrested in Mexico City. The idolized ex-alcoholic American Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) is in charge of the investigation since the murder happened in the American side of the border, but Mike Vargas participates as observer since the Mexican citizen Sanchez (Victor Millan) is the prime suspect. Meanwhile, Uncle Joe Grandi (Akim Tamitoff) unsuccessfully presses Susie, trying to convince her husband to drop the case. When Hank plants two dynamites in the house of Sanchez in a shoe box that Vargas had seen empty ten minutes before, he confronts Hanks. Joe Grandi witnesses their argument and associates to Hank to discredit Vargas, dishonoring Susie.""Touch of Evil"" is a masterpiece of malevolence and loss of humanity and one of my favorite movies ever. The long sequence in the beginning is in my opinion the best in cinema history, with a perfect timing. The black and white cinematography is amazing, with the perfect use of shadows and lighting. The story is fantastic and Orson Welles is awesome in the role of a despicable policeman that believes in his hunches, eternally grieves the loss of his wife and wishes to bring justice no matter the means and without any ethic. Janet Leigh performs a strong female character unusual in the 50's. Charlton Heston has also an unforgettable performance in the role of an ethical police office that is the opposite of Hank and prioritizes his work to his family, leaving his wife alone to seek the truth about his opponent.

175,Touch of Evil,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1123866/,"Rather than films like Citizen Kane (1941) and The Lady from Shanghai (1947), neither of which am I a big fan of, Touch of Evil evidences director/writer/star Orson Welles' capacity for cinematic genius. The story is engaging, suspenseful, tight and well paced; the cinematography is consistently beautiful, inventive and symbolic; the setting and overall tone of the film, including the performances, are captivating, yet slightly surreal and otherworldly; and there are many interesting subtexts. This all combines to create a complex artwork that will reward however far a viewer wishes to dig into the film.Based on a novel by Whit Masterson, Badge of Evil, Touch of Evil is a battle between two policemen--Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and Ramon Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston). Parallel to this is a kind of border battle between the United States, represented by Quinlan, and Mexico, represented by Vargas; the film is set in two border towns, frequently crossing over.As Touch of Evil opens, we see a bomb being placed in the trunk of a car in Mexico. A construction company owner, Mr. Linnekar, gets in with his girlfriend. Vargas and his new wife, Susan (Janet Leigh), manage to walk along next to the car--they're all crossing the border into the United States. Shortly after crossing, the bomb goes off. This brings the gruff Quinlan into the picture. His investigation of the bombing brings him into Mexico for suspects. Meanwhile, Vargas and his wife are being threatened by Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), a Mexican mob boss, and his underlings. Both Quinlan and Vargas are well respected in their countries, and both are used to getting what they want. But the bombing investigation ends up putting them at loggerheads, and Quinlan gradually turns out to have more than a ""touch of evil"".As with many of his films, Orson Welles ended up having to battle the studio to realize his artistic vision. Usually, as here, the battle was unsuccessful for him. Despite his 58-page memo detailing various problems with Universal's non-director supervised reshoots (by Harry Keller) and re-edits, because they felt that Welles' final cut ""could use some improvement"", the film was released in a form that was not satisfactory to Welles. The fiasco has resulted in various versions of Touch of Evil appearing throughout the years. The 58-page memo was thought to have been lost, but a copy was discovered relatively recently in Charlton Heston's possession. The film was recut in 1998 based on Welles' memo. So make sure that you watch the 111-minute version first released by Universal on DVD in 2000.The opening scene of Touch of Evil is famous, and rightfully so. Beginning with the timer being set on the bomb, then the bomb being placed in Linnekar's trunk before he gets into the car, we follow both the car and the relative ebb and flow of Vargases as they roughly walk alongside the car, all in one very long tracking shot that covers a lot of ground and features a lot of unusual angles. Welles stages the scene so that there are all kinds of complex background and foreground elements interacting with the car and our protagonist pedestrians. The suspense built up in this scene is incredible--you just know that bomb is going to go off, but you don't know just when, or who it is going to hurt. Compositionally, the scene is simply beautiful. The film is worth watching for this opening alone, but the whole of Touch of Evil features similar, meticulously planned artistry, filled with suspense.Welles as an actor tends to have a very peculiar way of speaking that is full of affectations. Sometimes this can be a detriment to the film, as it was in The Lady from Shanghai. Here, though, the oddity works, and this despite the fact that, like Woody Allen, he seems to direct his whole cast to deliver their dialogue as if they were him. As a result, Touch of Evil has very peculiar, contrapuntal scenes where people frequently talk on top of one another, with odd phrasing. It works because of the particular kinds of personality conflicts that Welles set up in the script. These are people who frequently _would_ talk on top of each other and occasionally not pay attention to each other.But that's not the only odd thing about the film. Welles managed to find locations that, shot in this highly stylized and cinematographically complex film-noir manner, seem almost otherworldly. Except for a couple expansive desert shots, Touch of Evil feels eerily claustrophobic, even though most locations aren't exactly enclosed. The various modes and settings are all perfect for their dramatic material, which is mostly dark and moody. One change that Universal made was the excision of a lot of comic relief material featuring the Grandi family. Universal was right to cut it, and wisely, Welles agreed.The music in the film is also extremely effective but unusual. Most of it is incidental. Latin and rock 'n' roll emanates from radios, for example, and the climax intermittently has a repeating, contextually haunting theme from a pianola.But of course the story is just as important. Although Welles stated hyperbolically at various points that he was trying to ""infuriate"" the audience with a somewhat inscrutable plot, and it's true that the plot isn't exactly given in a straightforward manner, once you figure out the gist, it's relatively simple but extremely captivating. At the same time, it is full of symbolism and subtexts, including commentary on justice systems and perhaps some irony about the popular conceptions of the U.S. versus Mexico (made more complex by the fact that Quinlan spends just as much time south of the border and Vargas seems to spend a lot of time north). But as for being annoyed, you're more likely to become infuriated with Quinlan, who becomes more and more deliciously despicable as the film unfolds.",positive,"[['Citizen Kane', 'The Lady',

176,The Killing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1074424/,"The formidably promising talent shown in ""Killer's Kiss"" helped to secure for Stanley Kubrick studio backing for his next straight thriller, ""The Killing,"" made in 1956 This was a much more ""professional"" job than its forerunner Kubrick had the casting of a bunch of actors so experienced in the ""character"" parts that as soon as they came into camera view you recognized them from a score of Hollywood movies ""The Killing"" lacks for me the dimension of humanity of its predecessor It reminded me of one of those documentaries that give you every conceivable fact with immaculate accuracy and leave you without the heart of the truth This has something to do with the style of the storytelling. Once again there is a narrator; only instead of a lonely failure with blood in his veins, this one sounds like a ""March of Time"" commentator: loud, confident, detached The film opens on the horses preparing for the off at the track and, even before the titles end, the dramatic music has started building the tension One by one we are introduced to the characters as once again, we don't know for a while what the plot is going to be; but this one uses the time to build the mystery and tension rather than to deepen the charactersJohnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a convict just out from five years in Alcatraz, master-minding the two million dollar hold-up He collects (how, we are never told) a bunch of flawed human beings to fit, like jigsaw pieces, into the intricacy of his plan There's an Irish barman, an amiable old book-keeper, a tough crooked cop; and there's little George Peatty, played by Elisha Cook Jr  he of the bulging eyes and mobile mouth; here the incarnation of fear and uncertainty and in countless other Hollywood thrillers the personification of the staring-eyed boy killer...Kubrick plays tricks with time as his characters become caught in the plot He takes each of them and plays his incident through to the next turn of the screw; then goes back to an earlier moment in time to see what somebody else was doingEven the incidental small parts have ""character"" stamped right through them The marksman hired to shoot a winning racehorse to cause a diversion from the robbery is a war veteran with deformed speech The old retired wrestler, who picks a fight with the police to create another diversionIf ""Killer's Kiss"" had one big dramatic set-piece, ""The Killing"" has a score of small dramatic touches to heighten the irony and the tension""The Killing"" is one of the most skillful and entertaining suspense movies of the Fifties It mesmerized like a ticking time bomb, and every few minutes, with sure skill, Kubrick recorded a new peak of suspense And all with very little violence, again, though with the obligatory sudden death",negative,"[['promising talent', 'Killer', 'Kiss', 'Stanley Kubrick', 'studio', 'backing', 'next straight thriller', 'Killing', 'job', 'forerunner', 'Kubrick', 'the casting', 'a bunch', 'character', 'camera', 'view', 'a score', 'Hollywood', 'Killing', 'the dimension', 'humanity', 'predecessor', 'every conceivable fact', 'immaculate accuracy', 'the heart', 'the truth', 'something', 'the style', 'the storytelling'], ['a narrator', 'a lonely failure', 'blood', 'March', 'Time', 'commentator', 'loud', 'The film', 'the off', 'the track', 'the dramatic music', 'the tension', 'a while', 'the plot', 'the time', 'the mystery', 'tension', 'Johnny Clay', 'Sterling Hayden', 'a convict', 'Alcatraz', 'dollar', 'hold-up', 'a bunch', 'jigsaw', 'the intricacy', 'plan', 'an Irish barman', 'an amiable old book-keeper', 'a tough crooked', 'cop', 'George Peatty', 'Elisha Cook Jr \x96', 'mobile mouth', 'the incarnation', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'countless', 'Hollywood', 'the personification', 'the staring-eyed boy', 'killer', 'Kubrick', 'time', 'the plot', 'incident', 'the next turn', 'the screw', 'moment', 'time', 'somebody', 'character', 'The marksman', 'racehorse', 'a diversion', 'the robbery', 'a war', 'veteran', 'deformed speech', 'The old retired wrestler', 'a fight', 'the police', 'another diversion', 'Killer', 'Kiss', 'big dramatic set-piece', 'Killing', 'a score', 'the irony', 'the tension', 'Killing', 'entertaining suspense', 'a ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'sure skill', 'Kubrick', 'a new peak', 'suspense', 'little violence', 'the obligatory sudden death']]","[['promising talent', 'Killer', 'Kiss', 'Stanley Kubrick studio backing', 'next straight thriller', 'Killing', 'job', 'forerunner Kubrick', 'casting', 'bunch of actors', 'character', 'parts', 'camera view', 'score of Hollywood movies', 'Killing', 'dimension of humanity', 'predecessor', 'documentaries', 'conceivable fact', 'immaculate accuracy', 'heart', 'truth', 'something', 'style', 'storytelling'], ['narrator', 'failure with blood', 'veins', 'March of Time', 'commentator', 'loud', 'film', 'horses', 'off', 'track', 'titles', 'dramatic music', 'tension', 'characters', 'while', 'plot', 'time', 'mystery and tension', 'characters Johnny Clay', 'Sterling Hayden', 'convict', 'years in Alcatraz', 'dollar hold-up', 'bunch', 'human beings', 'jigsaw pieces', 'intricacy', 'plan', 'Irish barman', 'amiable old book-keeper', 'crooked cop', 'George Peatty', 'Elisha Cook Jr \x96', 'eyes', 'mobile mouth', 'incarnation of fear', 'uncertainty', 'countless', 'Hollywood thrillers', 'personification', 'boy killer', 'Kubrick', 'tricks with time', 'characters', 'plot', 'incident', 'next turn', 'screw', 'moment in time', 'somebody', 'incidental small parts', 'character', 'marksman', 'racehorse', 'diversion', 'robbery', 'war veteran', 'deformed speech', 'old retired wrestler', 'fight', 'police', 'diversion', 'Killer', 'Kiss', 'big dramatic set-piece', 'Killing', 'score', 'small dramatic touches', 'irony', 'tension', 'Killing', 'suspense movies', 'Fifties', 'ticking time bomb', 'few minutes', 'sure skill', 'Kubrick', 'peak of suspense', 'little violence', 'obligatory sudden death']]"

178,The Night of the Hunter,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3241524/,"Veteran actor Charles Laughton's directional debut & perhaps the only feature film he ever directed is a rare breed that blends film-noir with German expressionism, resulting in a very unique looking cinema that unfolds its narrative in a lyrical manner but also makes up for some weird moments as the two styles are often at odds with each other.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Night of the Hunter focuses on one corrupt reverend-turned-serial killer who uses his charm to woo rich widows before killing them & fleeing with their money. Jailed for driving a stolen car, he learns from his cell mate about the large sum of money he had stolen & goes after his family once he's out of prison.Co-written & directed by Charles Laughton, The Night of the Hunter really benefits from the few elements it borrows from German expressionism of the silent era like eccentric camera angles, unconventional settings, surreal photography or silhouette figures but its inclusion of stylised dialogues & unrealistic acting in a Hollywood crime-drama is also unintentionally hilarious at times.Production design work is excellent, Cinematography makes terrific use of lighting, contrast & shadows, camera placement is inventive & every frame is captured in crisp detail. Editing is brilliant for the most part but its final act also feels overstretched, and performances are a mixed bag for the kids do a pretty good job in their given roles while Robert Mitchum's expressionist act borders on hamming.On an overall scale, The Night of the Hunter is experimental cinema at its finest for it tries to merge into film-noir what influenced the genre in the first place.

Les diaboliques is as much a horror movie as it is a thriller. When I watch this I perceive an intense mouldy smell throughout. The crumbling boarding school where the main characters live and act is worse than any nightmare  even the swimming pool filled with murky water appears like a menacing abyss. The stifling crummyness is accentuated by the plot: School teachers sit at the sadistic principal's table in the refectory and have to force unspeakably ghastly meals down their throats (only one glass of wine is allowed). The second location is the principal's lover's apartment in a dead borough somewhere in no man's land. It's stuffy and utterly claustrophobic. The transfer between the two places is made with a ""deux chevaux"" station wagon  its characteristic back part of corrugated sheet metal once was a common feature in our parts of the world, as was the snarling sound of the deux chevauxs engine. In the corrugated iron ""box"" sits a creaky wicker crate, which on the way back from the lover's apartment contains evidence of the crime, wrapped in a checkered wax tablecloth.

The tennis pro wants nothing to do with it, but dismisses the conversation out of hand.The murder of Guy's wife is also done well, although it is here where things get murky...how did he follow them for an hour without the other two men noticing him? After that, the premise falls apart completely. How could Guy not go to the police immediately? Why didn't he go after Bruno sent the evidence to his house? Why didn't the cops ask the man running the Tunnel Of Love about Guy, or anyone else for that matter? Why did the whole expected frame of Guy depend on his lighter being taken to the exact place? And finally, why the hell would a police officer SHOOT DIRECTLY INTO A CHILDREN'S RIDE AND KILL THE OPERATOR! Which led to the inevitable deus ex machina with Bruno being killed as the calliope fell to the ground, holding the incriminating cigarette lighter...As I said, the setup was perfect, and I will admit Bruno is one of the most disturbing characters I've seen on film (as Guy is perhaps the stupidest), but the second and third acts were so bad, it couldn't make up for a great beginning.",negative,"[['Hitchcock', 'IMDb Top', 'a good movie.The', 'setup', 'Bruno Anthony', 'hero', 'Guy Haines', 'a train', 'a one-sided conversation', 'trading'], ['The tennis', 'nothing', 'the conversation', 'hand.The murder', 'Guy', 'wife', 'an hour'], ['the premise'], ['the police'], ['Bruno', 'the evidence', 'house'], ['the man', 'Tunnel', 'Love', 'Guy', 'anyone', 'that matter'], ['the whole', 'frame', 'Guy', 'lighter', 'the exact place'], ['the hell', 'a police officer', 'SHOOT DIRECTLY INTO A CHILDREN', 'RIDE AND KILL THE OPERATOR'], ['the inevitable deus', 'Bruno', 'the calliope', 'the ground', 'the incriminating', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'the setup', 'Bruno', 'film', 'Guy', 'a great beginning']]","[['Hitchcock', 'IMDb Top', 'movie.The setup', 'Bruno Anthony', 'sports hero', 'Guy Haines', 'train', 'conversation about trading murders'], ['tennis', 'nothing', 'conversation', 'murder of Guy', 'wife', 'things', 'murky', 'hour', 'men'], ['premise'], ['police'], ['Bruno', 'evidence', 'house'], ['cops', 'man', 'Tunnel Of Love', 'Guy', 'anyone', 'matter'], ['whole', 'frame of Guy', 'lighter', 'exact place'], ['hell', 'officer SHOOT DIRECTLY INTO A CHILDREN', 'RIDE AND KILL THE OPERATOR'], ['inevitable deus', 'Bruno', 'calliope', 'ground', 'incriminating cigarette lighter', 'setup', 'Bruno', 'disturbing characters', 'film', 'Guy', 'third acts', 'great beginning']]"
183,Strangers on a Train,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0045666/,"One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution.  Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy.  But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film.  Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join.  Guy is the archetypal American, the working-class boy made good, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome.  Bruno is his destructive opposite, gay, decadent, 'European' (he lives off his father, in a Big House, and just lounges about dreaming of murder).  Bruno's life is one of repetition, circularity, whereas Guy moves straight ahead.  It is Bruno's achievement to move Guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to transgress (break the law, hope for murder (Bruno's)).Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy.  All the authority figures in the film are criticised - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna's incredibly Machiavellian, self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken.  Far from being the mother-hater of legend, Hitch, as Robin Wood perceived, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.Bruno's transgression turns the world topsy-turvy.  This is Hitch's most surreal film.  Whenever Guy is in his plot, he is filmed straight, with conventionally romantic music.  But whenever Bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, bizarre, much more fun.  This is Hitch's first truly American film, revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana.  Grown men puncture little boys' balloons, or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds. Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains.  Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees.  Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting Dali painting.  There is one of the greatest, and funniest, scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless, smiling Bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte.  Just look at any scene with Bruno in it, and watch it derail into the bizarre.Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more staid environs: Washington will never look the same again.  STRANGERS is also, VERTIGO notwithstanding, Hitch's most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses, there is the sustained homoeroticism, the remarkable play with 'riding' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman.And yet Hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense.  In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place.  Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification, willing Bruno into murder.  There is a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy down a drain.  The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success.  And Hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions, and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.STRANGERS is one of Hitch's five best films, and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema.  The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler.  Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp, standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts Guy.  The fairground finale is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set-piece, black comedy and symbolic site.  If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts Hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to Guy's debased serving of self.",positive,"[['Hitchcock', 'return', 'major studio', 'the side', 'chastened caution'], ['unrestrained film', 'a gleeful melange', 'vicious black comedy',

184,Rope,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1048815/,"I just saw this movie for the first time this year. I was amazed. Alfred Hitchcock does an absolutely amazing job of making the audience cringe. I read reviews about this movie saying that it wasn't well accepted by the audience when it first came out. But that is understandable because a lot of great classics aren't accepted when first released. One big example is The Shawshank Redemption, which didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. That doesn't make the content or the worth of the film any less. Rope was the twisted story based on the real life murder case of Leopold-Loeb. Two college students commit the ""perfect murder"" and invite the friends and family of their victim over for dinner. The acting is superb, especially from everyone's favorite, James Stewart. The fear builds slowly as this movie keeps you interested by morbid discussion that everyone has thought at one time or another. This movie really did creep me out, and although it might not be as thrilling as Rear Window or North by Northwest, it will not disappoint. You will be biting your nails for sure waiting to see what happens to the seemingly ""perfect murder"".

Police and paramedics arrived and the victim was pronounced dead on the scene.  Homicide detectives concluded that all evidence pointed to Frank Capra's film ARSENIC AND OLD LACE, which the man had watched on his dvd player while his wife was out.

189,Battleship Potemkin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0003593/,"With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly!

192,Dunkirk,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3766547/,"Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money.

193,Dunkirk,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3760993/,"Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings.9.5/10",positive,"[['Dunkirk', 'opinion', 'another masterpiece', 'mastermind', 'Christopher Nolan'], ['everything', 'the film', 'the film', 'a topic', 'the movie', 'for.The', 'film'], ['the non linear story', 'all pull', 'the intensity', 'screen', 'the last scene'], ['a war', 'film'], ['note', 'playing', 'heartbeat', 'a ticking', 'clock', 'a massive orchestra', 'screen'], ['The movie', 'the feeling', 'every soldier', 'the beach', 'the audience'], ['Confusion', 'turmoil', 'fear'], ['The cinematography', 'the run', 'time'], ['no lead', 'this film', 'anyone', 'a brilliant performance', 'criticisms', 'Dunkirk', 'depth', 'anything'], ['Nolan', 'the audience', 'care', 'the beach'], ['some form', 'the story', 'the direct perspective'], ['war', 'Ryan', 'an example', 'the plot', 'Cpt'], ['Miller', 'Ryan', 'a war', 'the war', 'THEM', 'THE WAR'], ['opinion', 'Dunkirk', 'STORY OF DUNKIRK'], ['Harry Style', 'character', 'Tom Hardy', 'character', 'Dunkirk'], [], ['the story', 'dialogue', 'a problem', 'the lack', 'character', 'depth', 'this type', 'terrible event', 'a place', 'someone', 'a character', 'a event', 'MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL', 'Nolan'], ['the top review', 'Dunkirk', 'IMDb', ""'lack"", 'emotion', 'the film', 'incorrect statement'], ['the lack', ""'brotherhood"", 'the feeling', 'something'], ['the longing', 'Private Ryan', 'format', 'war'], ['the reviewer', 'NO emotion', 'that beach', 'fear', 'confusion'], ['Nolan', 'Zimmer', 'DP']]","[['Dunkirk', 'opinion', 'masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan'], ['everything', 'film', 'film', 'topic', 'people', 'movie for.The', 'film', 'perspectives'], ['non linear story', 'pull', 'intensity', 'events', 'screen', 'last scene'], ['Hans', 'fitting scores', 'war film'], ['note playing', 'heartbeat sounds', 'ticking clock', 'other times', 'massive orchestra', 'screen'], ['movie', 'projects', 'feeling', 'soldier', 'beach', 'audience'], ['Confusion', 'turmoil and fear'], ['cinematography', 'run time'], ['lead', 'film', 'anyone', 'brilliant performance', 'criticisms of Dunkirk', 'characters', 'depth', 'anything'], ['Nolan', 'audience care', 'men', 'beach'], ['form', 'main characters', 'story', 'events', 'direct perspective', 'soldiers'], ['war films', 'private Ryan', 'example', 'plot', 'certain soldiers', 'Cpt'], ['Miller and Ryan', 'war', 'things', 'war', 'THEM', 'THE WAR'], ['opinion Dunkirk', 'STORY OF DUNKIRK'], ['Harry Style', 'character', 'Tom Hardy', 'character', 'Dunkirk'], ['main characters', 'felt'], ['film-making techniques', 'story', 'dialogue', 'people', 'problem', 'lack of character depth', 'type', 'terrible event', 'place for someone', 'character', 'event', 'MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL', 'Nolan'], ['review of Dunkirk', 'IMDb', ""'lack of emotion"", 'film', 'incorrect statement'], [""lack of 'brotherhood"", 'men', 'feeling', 'something epic'], ['longing', 'Private Ryan', 'format of war films'], ['reviewer', 'emotion', 'beach besides fear', 'confusion'], ['Nolan and Zimmer', 'DP', 'feelings.9.5/10']]"
194,Nightcrawler,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3188893/,"Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an out of work, eccentric young man trying to make it in LA. While he's clearly optimistic and driven, he just can't seem to find the right opportunity. He spends his time trying just about anything to make a buck. One night he randomly stumbles across an accident and notices the men filming it. With that, Lou is ushered into the world of late night crime journalism; also known as Nightcrawling. While his initial forays into the business are unsuccessful, he eventually gets a break when he meets Nina (Rene Russo), a well-seasoned TV newswoman who is always in the market for compelling footage. Every late night tragedy now becomes a new opportunity; and Lou doesn't hesitate to capitalize on them. But the more successful he becomes and the further he rises in the business, the more clear it is that Lou is more than a just a savvy business man.Gynlenhal is memorizing as Lou Bloom! Lou undergoes a kind of metamorphosis; at first he exudes the determination and drive you can't help but cheer for (and see a bit of yourself in). Then he slowly develops and learns to wield his intellect and cunning to his advantage. But eventually his zeal and tenacity become something else entirely. You don't really realize what's happened until it's obvious; Lou is a monster. And he's the kind of monster you don't see coming. It's brilliant work really and the effectiveness of Gynlenhal's performance is hard to deny. This is the best Gynlenhal performance I've ever seen! Russo is also excellent as the hardened, ""do whatever it takes to get the ratings"" Producer Nina. She's clearly underrated here as her vile, slimy character goes unnoticed for most of the film. It's not until near the end that you realize that she's really not that much different than Lou. There's a great scene where Nina is confronted by another member of the news team about airing footage that goes against virtually every rule of responsible journalism. Nina dismisses him in such a swift and ruthless manner it's amazing to watch; his reaction so succinctly captures the horror of it all and it's nothing short of brilliant. Russo's award worthy turn as this repulsive figure is what makes that scene one of the best of the year; she had to deliver a strong performance here to rival Jake's and she succeeds in doing so. For his directorial debut I don't think Gilory could've chosen a more fitting location than LA. The backdrop of the LA night only seems to heighten the horror of it all, the sliminess and the treachery. The city were so many go to extraordinary lengths to achieve fame and notoriety is the perfect breeding ground for this kind of business. The rags to riches element of Lou's rise kept me engaged as I always find those kinds of stories compelling, but the parallels to the current media were immediate. This film is a critique of the culture of our news media; which seems these days to focus more on entertainment, ratings and driving narrative, instead of providing information and educating viewers. Nina mirrors this precisely in her pursuit of a great story and it's chilling how clear the similarities are. Think about it? How often do you find yourself wandering why the news is covering celebrities as opposed to real news? Another element portrayed here is the TMZ effect in the media. To desire to get the salacious footage or the private phone call at any cost, with no consideration whatsoever for the people involved or how this will affect them. Lou stops at nothing to not only get the story first, but to create a particular narrative to feed into the viewer's already preconceived notions and fears. I found myself looking inward and asking is this the kind of behaviour we're rewarding when we watch the latest TMZ video? Is this what we're craving when we revel is the fall on a public figure because of a private conversation or their personal beliefs? The answer seems to be yes, and that's alarming. The fact is the news and entertainment media has fused together to become what I call edutainment. And we're the proverbial pigs that constantly feed at this trough. Nightcrawler is also very much about corporate greed. Lou does everything in his power to use, manipulate and discard an employee when necessary in is this film solely to keep the majority share of his enterprise; with no sincerity, remorse or consideration. When we watch these characters on film we cringe and believe they are horrible, despicable people. Yet in business, we call these people successful. Why is that? To answer this answer, I had to recall a documentary I watched a while back called The Corporation where they studied the behaviours of various corporations and attempted to equate their behaviour to that of a real person. And what kind of person did their research find most resembled a corporation? A psychopath. What The Corporation mused about in theory, Nightcrawler illustrates perfectly on screen. Gyllenhaal fully embodies the process of becoming a monster and it's chilling to watch unfold. So does Nightcrawler have a ""happy ending""? If Lou were a corporation we'd say it's reached a new summit of success and would call it a successful, profitable company. Is this what it takes to succeed in today's world? It's unsettling to even consider, but I believe people like this are ""succeeding"" in life. They may very well be at the helm of many powerful companies and organizations. But these kinds of psychopaths won't bludgeon you to death with a knife, but with a smile while wearing an exquisitely tailored suit. And this is why Nightcrawer is one of the most important film you'll see this year.

195,Nightcrawler,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234357/,"Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It's a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.There's a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, he'll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal's chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.Nightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It's a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don't want to get out. It's intense, it's funny, it's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it's real.

It has absolutely everything I could want in a smart and thought provoking sci-fi movie. It had me at the first several seconds - it gripped my attention from the get go and never let up. Music and the actor played a great part in this, but the story itself is what's really amazing. So simple, yet so complex.

197,Arrival,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5560834/,"""I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time"", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use ""the weapon"".There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such.

Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.There is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"".District 9 has so much to like.

204,Mystic River,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1297834/,"Call me simple, but I just watched Mystic River for the first time last night and it appears to condone the killing of the character played by Tim Robbins in a sort of, ""Well, he's been all messed up since he was raped and molested as kid, anyway, so doing him in does everyone - especially him - a big favor."" Excuse me, but I think that's a terribly brutal message to send. Yes, physical and emotional abuse can cause untold damage, but there are ways for people to seek out treatment through therapy.The best thing about this film is how most everyone kind of 'expects' the Tim Robbins character to be found guilty and is surprised in the end. The fact that the writer makes 'Dave' actually complicit and responsible for _another_ murder does not wash with me as a sort of way of saying 'Well, he deserved what he had coming to him' as is insidiously and mischievously implied. It seems like a cop-out to me.The bottom line is that Sean Penn's character brutally murders his childhood friend based on hearsay and the third friend, played by Kevin Bacon, suggests he will just look the other way even though it's pretty clear he knows Penn did it. And he's a cop!So what the f*ck is going on with the little speech Penn's character's wife gives at the end of the film? ""You could be the king of this town?"" Maybe true, but also clear is the fact that he's going to be eaten by his demons in the process.And all of this is OK? Watching the freaking parade stand murderers and friends side by side?

I think it's in there not so much for its ironic 'Lady Macbeth' horror, as for its balancing effect on all those moviegoers who actually agree with her and see the Sean Penn character as flawed but heroic: a kinder, gentler Dirty Harry.   There's a reason why the film makers eliminated a crucial moment from the book: In the book, the Kevin Bacon character promises the Marcia Gay Harden character that he will prove that the Sean Penn character committed murder and that he will prosecute him for it. Instead, Eastwood plays it cozy, leaving the legal consequences of the vigilantism ambiguous, just in case his core audience happens to think that what Sean Penn's character did was wrong, maybe, but understandable and justified.

206,The Bourne Identity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0756437/,"I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition ""Triple X."" There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.Besides ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Ronin"" is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in ""Ronin"" and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's past.To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in ""Bourne"" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).While not being perfect, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends.

That's the question Matt Damon's super-spy Jason Bourne wants to know and it could cost him his life. In the starring role, Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the charming and lethal secret agent on the hunt to find out who he is. Mastering different martial arts styles and weapons training in addition to several foreign languages, Damon is a force when he takes the screen as Bourne. The film's action is endless as Bourne is chased around Europe by assassins of the secret he is out to discover.

208,Children of Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1687464/,"Unbelievable what I read about this movie! I don't have one single positive comment to make about it since during the entire movie I only contemplated whether to leave or see it through hoping to see it turn for the better and at least get my money's worth.What a bore. What a lack of suspense. What an inane script. What a poor plot, it leads nowhere. The story totally fails to unravel, it is poorly acted, especially by Clair Hope Ashity who puts in an abysmal amateur performance and Julianne Moore who is just an add on to attract some viewers but more than clearly fails to impress during her way too brief appearance. The Human Project is mentioned continuously during the movie and comes up as a boat named Tomorrow? Please! Give us a break! You would think that somewhere in the process of writing, directing, and producing this unmitigated disaster of a film, someone would have paused and said ""eh...guys....what 'TF' are we doing here exactly?"". The characters have absolutely zero depth, the setting is more artificial than a Borg cube, and the storyline....well, I'm still trying to figure out what the storyline WAS, exactly.Things not explained in this movie include: the title, The Human Project, the infertility, the reason for the treatment of the immigrants, what happened to the rest of the world, why Julianne Moore is offed by the Fishes, what the Fishes actually DO to help immigrants (other than kill every native they encounter???), how the Fishes believe that having the baby will save THEM (not just provide hope for humanity), why the army wouldn't immediately take the mother and child into custody rather than letting them stroll through a gun battle, why they wouldn't have gone worldwide public with the news of a pregnancy or birth to begin with, given the celebrity of the youngest person on earth, and I could go on and on and on. If this is the thought-provoking side of this film everyone is talking about then I think I just wet my pants. That's not thought provoking, it'splain stupidity? And the lack of logic in the movie is just stupendous.Starting with their ""silent"" escape from the farm, when they were opening and closing car doors and trunks with enormous noise 5 meters from their captors. And ending with the unreasonably hopeful mood of the terrible 'ending', despite the absolute uselessness of having one accidental baby for the restoration of the world. Sweet lord, some of you reviewers are seriously disparate for a hopeful state of mind, aren't you.This is the third movie I recently saw based on high ratings and claims of superb acting, story, directing and cinematography and have been utterly disappointed with. We all know that there will be film companies out there writing their own rave reviews, but I'm beginning to question if there are not now rave review factories fixing the movie ratings on IMDb.

209,Children of Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617338/,"I first saw 'Children of Men' when it came out, 10 years ago, and while I liked it a lot, I kind of forgot about it soon. At the time, it failed to resonate with me on a deeper level - which in hindsight I find astounding. Last month, a decade later almost to the day, I suddenly felt the urge to revisit the film (because it was mentioned in an article about ""long takes""), and upon re-watching it, it just blew my mind. This film is so, so, good! It not only manages in many aspects to be the most prophetic - and most shockingly realistic - sci-fi film I have ever seen: it achieves that feat with a level of style and through such an abundance of fantastic creative choices and innovative camera techniques that I was simply left in awe. I was forced to conclude that this film was a visionary piece of art (and how that fact had eluded me the first time around I couldn't - and still can't - explain). It's a cinéphile's dream come true; it's a masterpiece in the true sense of the word.'Children of Men' is a gut-wrenching look at an all too possible future, but it also works as a heart-stopping, adrenaline-rush-inducing piece of entertainment featuring some of the most breathtaking camera work you'll ever see.The performances are flawless. The artwork, the production design, the music; I could go on and on: this is one of those few real masterworks where everything just comes together right. And I believe the final 30 minutes of the film rank among the finest achievements in the history of Cinema.

The different levels on which this movie works are impressive. As a love story we begin to believe that the quirky `loser' couple is unconditionally bound together.  As a pseudo `film noir' we begin to care about the fate of the central characters.  In the suspense/thriller/crime drama mode there are plenty twists and turns to push us to the edge and pull us back just in time.  The action scenes are deliciously violent and unlike most other films, this one gives us pinches of humor sprinkled in amidst the mayhem.   Even `the King' alter ego is woven in credibly enough to improve our understanding of the Clarence Worley character.The plot, albeit original, fresh and mesmerizing, seems somehow secondary to the characters and the characterizations.  Any of several rolls could have been performed over the top by what seemed to be an ensemble cast. But director Scott lets the talent go just far enough. Even the remainder of the supporting cast is wonderful; Saul Rubinek in particular does a terrific job as the puffed-up/ego-feeding movie producer.  Hollywood missed giving this movie and its cast proper recognition.With enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters, True Romance gives us the `best bang for our buck' in years. The Walken/Hopper scene alone is worth the `price of admission' not to mention the Gandolfini/Arquette and Slater/Oldman match ups.

Pacino delivers an excellent performance (do you really expect any less from him?) as the main guy Carlito who just wants out of the whole gangster game. By his side is the almost unrecognisable Sean Penn. An afro wearing cocaine addict who just seems determined to lure Carlito back into the kind of world he is trying to leave.This film is easy to enjoy with a great story and a great cast.

213,Carlito's Way,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1966662/,"Al Pacino, Sean Penn, and Penelope Ann Miller create an artistic and romantic twist to the gangster genre in Carlito's way, story of a convicted gangster by the name of Carlito Brigante, known to his ex-lover as Charlie, who manages to get his way out of jail thanks to crooked drug-addicted lawyer David Kleinfield. After his release, he's convinced himself that he's never going back to his life of crime, but before he knows it, he's inevitably being pulled back thanks to his corrupt friends and family.While Scareface centered around the action and grittiness of the gangster life more then anything else, Carlito's Way tends to lean to the romantic side, giving the film an artsy twist. For example, in one scene there is a close up shot of a revolver, the chamber slowly moving to an empty slot. There is another famous scene with Carlito inside of a dark bathroom, his back against a wall with a pistol in hand. The way the camera is placed, the way Carlito is standing, and the way the lighting reflects off of the wall and his leather jacket are all taken in to account by De Palma. To make a long story short, Carlito's Way is very beautiful, and this is all thanks to De Palma. He directs the movie very well, you can tell that he put some true dedication in to this film.Needless to say, the acting is incredible, no matter what you might be hearing. Al Pacino is as always great, and Penelope Ann Miller is as well. But most of the time you'll find yourself deeper inside Sean Penn's character then Pacino's or anyone else's. He's steals nearly every scene he's in, if not then he steals all of them. He's almost too convincing.The scores are very, very strong and add on to the artistic feel to the movie. Not only do they add on to that, but it adds to the tension, the romance, and the tears as well.To sum it all up, Carlito's Way is the best gangster film ever made.

His quest is really tough, as his opponent is determined and powerful, but he has the help of three invaluable partners: Malone (Connery), a no-nonsense experienced cop, Wallace (Martin Smith), an accountant who will try to help bring tax charges against Capone, and Stone (Garcia), a great shooter.As I noted before the film is brilliantly directed, with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat, or the one with the baby in the train station, having become classic.

217,Dawn of the Dead,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0158748/,"When you want brutal, look no further, but when you also want to see perhaps the greatest of all comic-book movies not based on a comic-book, it's in George Romero's original take on his continuing mythology. It's not just one of the towering horror films, or horror comedies (what will a poor dead fellow do when the escalator starts?!) but one of the great sequels, more ambitious and ass-kicking than its predecessor, with a filmmaker more confident and technically proficient with his abilities.Romero didn't originally want to do *any* sequel to his original 'Night', but after a visit by some friends to a soon-to-open mall nearby his hometown of Pittsburgh, it struck a chord as to who would be coming here – and what so much consumerism in one place would mean. ""Why do they come here?"" one of the four survivors that happens upon this mall swarming with these flesh-eaters asks another. ""This meant something to them. Instinct, maybe.

It's more about, this is where we are at NOW, and in that sense, though broader and a whole LOT bloodier, it holds a place right next to a film like Network as one of the magnificent satires of its time and place, and as much about what the public is like. Romero acts as both pessimist and optimist in this world though; past all the chopped limbs, exploding heads (oh yeah!), Tom Savini stunt and make-up and intestines ripped apart, what holds up the film for me is seeing these four characters come to grip with the horror they've made for themselves, holding up in this ""paradise"" of a mall.Balls-to-the-wall horror, social horror, and some genuine paranoid horror stuff (note to self, never try and fire a gun at a single zombie when in a dark room full of electrical wiring and pipes), and plenty of rock and roll attitude, this is a personal favorite and the most entertaining horror film of its time.

218,In the Heat of the Night,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2495340/,"""Gradualism may have some value in politics. But in art, it just represent a stale, hackneyed period, to be forgotten as soon as we can get on to the real work at hand."" - Clifford Mason It's hard to watch Sidney Poitier's ""classic"" movies these days. In the 50s and 60s he became Hollywood's token black man. The new, upstanding, righteous, handsome, dignified, strangely sex-less, African American, symbolic of progressivism, Civil Rights movements and back-patting, liberal film-makers. Poitier wasn't just an actor, he was a flag bearer, smuggling all that was good and just about ""The Negro"" into Hollywood. White audiences loved him. Blacks thought he was a joke. Ironically, Poitier got into acting because he was ashamed of his Afro-Caribbean roots, and worked frantically to disguise his West Indian accent. He wanted to be a proper speaking white man. Others used him because they believed that the ""Negro image"" is best served or rehabilitated by a black version of a white man in grey flannel suits, who takes on white problems and inherits a white man's sense of what's wrong in the world.Most of Poitier's films during this period followed a pattern. Director Stanley Kramer, not one to shy away from middle-brow message movies, had him tied to a white guy in ""The Deviant Ones"", audience and co-star Tony Curtis learning that ""useful black men are our friends too"". Meanwhile, ""The Bedford Incident"" saw Poitier turn his nose up to war mongering white boys whilst snidely calling them ""sir"". Later, ""Duel at Diablo"" proved that the black man can also be an Indian killing cowboy, whilst dressed in slick, suave, grey suits of course, and the inspirational ""To Sir With Love"" saw Poitier playing a sex-less London school teacher whose students learn that ""hey, black people are great and make good teachers in white schools"". And don't forget ""A Patch of Blue"", in which Poitier plays a reporter who falls in love with a blind white girl. Typical of Poitier-film reversals, he's well off, suited and suave looking, while she's a dirty white girl from the slums. Their romance is sterile - white audiences weren't ready for interracial smooching - Poitier rescuing the girl and then politely sending her off to a camp for the blind, never to see her again. Then there's ""Guess Who's Coming To Diner?"", in which Poitier finally gets to kiss a white girl (it's more of a peck), after which he proves he's a better white man than her family of arrogant Caucasians.These films are all entertaining in a sleazy, salacious sort of way, but the fact is that they trade entirely in countercliches and do not, as they proudly claim, change the stereotypes that black actors are subjected to. They are contrivances, art-less, in which Poitier is reduced to a showcase Negro who exists only in the white man's view of him. Always in clean suits, pure of motivation, dignified, surrounded by stupid, mean whites, the Poitier Hero, antiseptic and one-dimensional, always finds himself in a totally white world, with no wife, no sweetheart, no woman, no black friends, and tasked with using his innate goodness to solve white problems for whites. Such ""Black Saviour"" tales are resurfacing today. Think ""Blind Side"", ""Precious"", ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"", anything with Morgan Freeman and Obama mania.And so ""In The Heat of the Night"" stars Sidney Poitier as a grey suited, angelic white man in black-face who finds himself trapped in the Deep South. Surrounded by racist, stupid, redneck cops, Poitier spends the first half of the film schooling white boys and proving that blacks are superior to whites at police work, medical examinations, manners, looks and speech. He's an African American Ubermensch.The film was directed by Norman Jewison, though, a director who makes comedies when he's not bludgeoning us with message movies. So ""Night"" has a sense of humour which your typical Poitier movie doesn't, Poitier's superiority played for laughs, and red-neck inferiority treated as a joke (see ""Watermellon Man""). Other good moments include passing shots of workers in fields (alluding, briefly, to the South's reliance on the slave trade) and Poitier's stand-off with a wealthy local. Indeed, though the film is oft touted as being ""progressive"" for highlighting ""white on black"" racism, the only thing it deals believably with is ""black on white"" racism, Poitier learning to check his aggression, stop instinctively blaming wealthy whites, and to work with lug headed whites for a better tomorrow. In contrast, ""white on black"" racism is treated ridiculously. The film pretends to be progressive but amounts to odious titillation, playing like a lynch mob lynching whites while blacks are schooled on the dangers of stereotyping rich folk with less melanin. It's the kind of film where audiences snicker because a black man slaps the face of a rich, pampered, arrogant, locally powerful white man...but not before he slapped our hero, of course.Aesthetically the film is effective, Jewison capturing the heat, gentle winds and lazy atmosphere of the Deep South, and occasionally treating us to some moody night-time photography. The film's acting garnered awards but is mostly caricatural; a collection of tics. Rod Steiger's a mean curmudgeon, and Poitier does his Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart in black-face routine. Quincey Jones, Hollywood's go-to black-composer, did the score.7.9/10 – Peep-show sensationalism, diluted by some moments of humour.

219,In the Heat of the Night,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1178915/,"One of the great films of the 60s, ""In the Heat of the Night"" hasn't aged a bit in the four decades since its release and now deserves to be ranked with the great films of all time. Beautifully atmospheric, Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography and Norman Jewison's first rate direction make you feel the humidity of the small Mississippi town in which a black detective teams with the redneck sheriff to solve the murder of an important industrialist.As sheriff Bill Gillespie, Rod Steiger is superb in his Oscar winning role, and this film provides Sidney Poitier with some of his greatest screen moments, including his famous admonition to Steiger that became the title of the less impressive 1970 spin off: ""They call me MISTER Tibbs!"" This is one of the few politically correct films to make its point without resorting to heavy-handed, sanctimonious preaching. Stirling Silliphant's Oscar winning screenplay never hits a false note, and the change that occurs in the relationship between the leading characters is subtle, and, therefore, believable. The two stars are ably supported by an outstanding cast of both veterans (Lee Grant, Warren Oates, Beah Richards) and newcomers (Scott Wilson, Quentin Dean, and the delightfully creepy Anthony James). The score by Quincy Jones, featuring Ray Charles' rendition of the title song, captures the proper mood throughout. In a year when the odds-makers were predicting an Oscar victory for ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or ""The Graduate,"" ""In the Heat of the Night"" surprised the prognosticators by taking the Best Picture prize and four other Oscars. Considering its theme of racial tolerance, it seemed an appropriate choice at an Oscar ceremony that was postponed following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The film's theme made it timely, but its artistry makes it timeless.

220,Charade,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0080751/,"Charade is an elegant and witty adventure. Audrey Hepburn is a UN translator whose husband is killed by a seemingly motiveless murderer. In her Paris home she is menaced by ex-soldiers James Coburn, Ned Glass and George Kennedy, fed confusing information by spy Walter Matthau and aided by the charming but elusive Cary Grant. The plot (five men who were behind enemy lines in wartime Germany stole a hoard of gold. Now four of them have come back to find the loot and the man who double-crossed them) is secondary to the suspense generated in the treasure hunt across Paris. The villains  particularly Kennedy as a one-armed hood who literally makes sparks fly  are genuinely menacing to poor Hepburn's sexy young widow, and trying to work out just on who's side Grant is provides much entertainment (especially as he changes identity every quarter of an hour). Charade's director Stanley Donen (former dancer and maker of musicals) easily out-Hitches Hitchcock. In its way, this was a hugely influential film. The villain with a metal hook motif was taken up again in the Moore Bond Live and Let Die, while the music and editing influenced the later Bond cycle (the film even has a pre-title teaser scene, a trait the later Bonds would make their own). The subplot, about stealing gold during wartime, provided the basis for the Clint Eastwood actioneer Kelly's Heroes and the recent George Clooney effort Three Kings. The photography, lighting and music (courtesy of Henri Mancini) are as good as  if not better than  anything the Bonds of the time could come up with (this is 1963, the same year as From Russia With Love). Particularly riveting is a rooftop fight between Grant and the one-armed Kennedy. This is one of the best fights in cinema history, nasty, suspenseful and with a viciousness that only the Dalton and Brosnan Bond movies have matched in the action films of recent years. When watching the film, you become aware that Grant was the model for the screen Bond. It's a pity he turned down Dr. No and never played the part, but at least here we have a taste of what his Bond might have been like. If you like comedy thrillers you won't want to miss a moment of this one.

Kennedy and James Coburn), one of the best comedy actors ever (Walter Matthau), and the city of Paris. Nothing could possibly go wrong, don't you think? Audrey Hepburn is Reggie Lambert, an American girl married to a swiss guy called Charles Lambert (at least that's what she thinks)... She's spending her holidays in some ski resort with her best girlfriend Sylvie and the son of hers. Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, so she gets back to Paris. Once there she found out that her husband's been killed. From this moment on she gets involved in the funniest spy plot ever.Watching Charade you'll have an smile on your face from the beginning till the very end. And you'll burst out laughing in many moments of the movie. Stanley Donen gets out of every sequence very skillfully and, as he did before in Seven Brides or Singin' In The Rain, he probes he's an outstanding filmmaker. There're two names that come into my mind every time I watch this movie: Alfred Hitchcock and Blake Edwards. In Charade, Stanley Donen merged suspense and romantic-comedy in the best possible way. Actor's selection is just perfect, the chemical between Hepburn and Grant is simply unbeatable. One more perfect couple to add to Hollywood's Couple's Hall Of Fame: side by side with Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn-Cary Grant (him once again!), Lauren Bacall-Humphrey Bogart... It's not easy to find two actors so compatible. What to say about George Kennedy or James Coburn? Best known for their roles in action movies, they do their best as CIA agents. And least but not less, we got Walter Matthau, one of the best comedy actors ever (I should've put Walter Matthau-Jack Lemon in my Couple's Hall Of Fame!) doing the best he can (that is a lot!) as (in principle) an American Embassy employee. So if you liked North By Northwest or Breakfast At Tiffany's, if you think that there's never been a more classy actress than Audrey Hepburn, if you do believe that Cary Grant's been one of the more talented actors ever (and one of the funniest ones)... please, don't miss Charade.

222,The Manchurian Candidate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3685683/,"As a long time fan of this film I note there is little that has gone unmentioned in the positive reviews - except this. I would like to put in a word of praise for the academy award winning editor Ferris Webster. Webster's crowning achievement was the famed 'garden party' sequence in which the malevolent communist agents are transformed into ladies at a garden club and back again, the vertigo of the circling camera draws us into the actual mental state of the brainwashed captives. Each camera movement, each shot was so exquisitely timed and placed that this is almost equal to the shower-bath scene in Psycho as a classic of modern editing. This scene is still studied in film schools by future editors.

224,High Noon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3561266/,"HIGH NOON is an exciting and inspiring western. Honestly, this is the little piece of art. The sheriff of a town in the Wild West all alone must confront the gang killer. This is a film in which all components are working properly.Through the story permeate the diversity of human character. This is a movie about a brave and standoffish sheriff who at any moment to firmly take a stand. Opposite him are new wife, former love, a city full of punk and a coward (each has a valid reason) and a group of bandits. The director conceived action, so that it coincides duration of the story and the actual duration of the film. Innovative and successful. Zinnemann scored steady growth of tension, which further intensified the use of close-ups of the main character, from which emanated despair and loneliness. Several anthology, visually magnificent scene was achieved by using a camera on the crane, which, although not entirely a novelty, is not overly used in the cinema of the time. Black - white photography is more than impressive.It is important to recognize the courage and composure in a man. All against one. The film touches on many issues that were not typical of westerns, such as individual responsibility, alienation, hypocrisy and of course human morality. People are often in difficult or desperate situations on their own. I have the impression that this simple story with dramatic consequences. I do not mean you no harm, on the contrary I want you well, but I can not help you. People are too often silent observers, although ""something"" directly concerns them.Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane simply dominated in this film. Age and visible fatigue contribute to realistic presentation of his character. Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane was a young wife who is coping quite well. Pacific attitude is ordered at the right time. Katy Jurado as Helen Ramírez is a mysterious Mexican tied to both sides. Lloyd Bridges as Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell was deputy to whom no one can rely on.Emotional and moral film with good climatic ending.

225,High Noon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1342660/,"John Wayne was totally wrong to call this movie un-American. Courage and cowardice are universal emotions, and the attitudes of the characters in High Noon are, I think, incredibly truthful and telling. I know that if I lived in the Wild West, had a job and family, and was asked to stand up and fight against a gang of gun-toting psychos I would probably not be able to do it. That's why Gary Cooper's Will Kane is such a remarkable character in terms of self-respect, morality and inner strength. It's the way he MUST uphold the law even though it will perhaps cost him his wife and his life. It is the various townfolk with whom most of us will identify, even if it makes us feel shame or unworthiness to admit it. No matter how bravely we act, nor how much we want to think heroically of ourselves, 90% of us would cower in the shadows when the time came to do what Will Kane does in this movie.On his wedding day, dependable lawman Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just handed in his badge and is preparing to leave town with his bride Amy (Grace Kelly) when he receives devastating news. An old adversary, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), has been pardoned for crimes that he should have hanged for and is on his way to Kane's town of Hadleyville to get revenge. He is due on the noon train, leaving Kane one hour to either run for his life or make preparations to fight. Kane and Amy set off at full gallop, hoping to put some miles between themselves and danger, but Kane doesn't get far before he feels compelled to turn back. With the new sheriff not due for a day, he just can't let go of the extraordinary sense of duty and responsibility he feels towards his town. However when he gets back to town he gets quite a shock - for no-one has the guts (nor, in some instances, the inclination) to fight alongside him against the Miller gang. As time ticks unstoppably towards noon, Kane gradually realises that if he's going to stop Miller and his boys, he's going to have to do it alone!Cooper's performance is extremely powerful and he received a thoroughly deserved Oscar for it. Kelly is good as his bride, although many viewers will find her character hard to like. Lloyd Bridges has a brilliant early role as Kane's deputy, while the very best of the supporting pack is Katy Jurado as a Latino woman whose ""history"" with most of the men in town puts her in an unenviable position when the shooting starts. Fred Zinnemann directs the film outstandingly, making each scene fit into the grander scheme of things with literate precision. Any aspiring young film-maker wanting to learn how to pace a film correctly should watch High Noon with a close eye, for it is unparallelled as the most perfectly paced film of all-time. The music by Dmitri Tomkin - plus that incredible ballad ""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling"" by Tex Ritter - is just one more element that makes High Noon one of the great masterpieces.

226,Notorious,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2130285/,"A great Director, Dream Lead Pair and star cast and a wonderful plot makes Notorious a remarkable film . Set in Brazil, this is a story about a German woman who is assigned by the Americans to spy the German activity in Brazil against America. This particular girl is chosen because her father was a traitor who betrayed America and killed himself in prison. Detestation of her father's activities, a sense of patriotism and some coaxing by American intelligent officer and love interest makes her take this job. The person who she is supposed to spy upon also is a blast from her past who offers her to marry him and she does even that for the job.If you are expecting this movie to be full of thrills and suspense which is a trademark of Hitchcock movies, then you may be disappointed. The pace of the movie is also a tad slower than his other notable movies. But still it kept me engrossed and anticipating till the end because of the sheer genius of the director. Hitchcock movies are also known for their remarkable climaxes and endings (Psycho, North By Northwest, Rear Window etc). The end of this movie is abrupt and makes you feel it is incomplete. But I personally think this also is a Hitchcock way to say 'Surprise' ! About the Lead Pair, it can only be called as a dream to see these two screen legends together. Cary Grant as the American Intelligence Officer is as good a casting you will get. His screen persona is simply amazing. But I am in complete love with the leading lady of this movie - Ingrid Bergman. She is slowly but surely becoming one of my all time favorite actresses (I have watched Casablanca, Gaslights and Notorious).She is a pure Screen Goddess with a deadly combination of looks, grace and exceptional acting (She has won 3 Oscars in her career for acting).

228,The Big Sleep,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0970752/,"Starting out, I must advise that my review here is for the 1945 pre-release version of ""The Big Sleep"", which had quite a few scenes redone prior to it's release to general audiences in October 1946. With filming already completed by Spring of 1945, there were two main reasons for the year and a half delay; first, with World War II underway, Warner Brothers felt compelled to get it's war related films into theaters while they were still timely. Secondly, Producer/Director Howard Hawks was convinced he had to re-shoot some scenes involving Lauren Bacall, who was critically panned in her latest film, ""Confidential Agent"" with Charles Boyer. In the original print, Bacall is presented in a few scenes wearing a distracting veil, and it's her more glamorous side that the studio needed to capitalize on.Much has been made of the complexity of the ""The Big Sleep"", and deservedly so. On my latest viewing, I took pen in hand to keep track of the characters and situations. That only helped so much. For example, Humprey Bogart's character, private detective Philip Marlowe is tailing rare book dealer Arthur Gwynne Geiger for his client General Sternwood; Geiger allegedly holds gambling debts involving a few thousand dollars on Sternwood's daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). Following Geiger's auto to his residence, Marlowe studies his surroundings, and then hears a woman's scream and gunshots, followed immediately by two cars careening out of the driveway. Entering the house, he discovers the lifeless body of Geiger, and a spaced out Carmen Sternwood. Out of this scenario are offered two, maybe three possibilities. First, General Sternwood's chauffeur Owen Taylor is implicated, as he had fallen in love with Carmen and wanted to defend her from blackmail. Secondly, a shady Geiger accomplice Joe Brody may have done it, OR may have chased the guilty Taylor from the crime scene either to retrieve some incriminating blackmail film or to remove him as a potential witness. OR, the spaced out Carmen could have killed Geiger herself, and although this wasn't offered as a possibility in the film, she WAS present, and may have been entirely coherent when the murder was committed.And this is how the story proceeds. Even more characters are introduced to spin off the original plot, and Marlowe is off investigating the proprietor of a gambling house named Eddie Mars, Brody's accomplice Agnes Lozier, the salesgirl at the rare bookstore, and Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), a tail on Marlowe who gets rubbed out after setting up a meeting with Agnes that might provide more information to go on.All of the intrigue aside, it's the chemistry once again between Bogey and by now, Mrs. Bogey, Lauren Bacall that propels this movie forward. Whether just sizing each other up at the beginning of the film, or as unwilling accomplices and possible lovers by film's end, it's the snappy banter and smoldering tension between the two that put the sizzle into this edgy noir thriller. As if to prove how great an actor Bogart was, this film offers us a glimpse at his incredible range. Of course I'm referring to the bookstore scene in which Bogey portrays a nerdy client seeking information on a non existent rare book. With a mere upturn of his hat's brim and a cleverly positioned pair of glasses, Bogart completely transforms into an almost unrecognizable comic character who befuddles and infuriates the store's proprietress. He follows that up with a walk across the street, and a double entendre filled conversation with a disarmingly seductive Dorothy Malone in a scene that could have lingered into X-rated territory if not for the task at hand.One could go on and on about ""The Big Sleep"", and others have, but to appreciate the film's mystery, darkness and noir complexity you'll have to view it.

229,The Big Sleep,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0033712/,"This classic of American cinema, actually made during the war and released in 1946, got a whole nation of young men affecting Bogey mannerisms, raising their eyebrows or showing their teeth while grimacing, and especially pulling on their earlobes while deep in thought, a smoking cigarette dangling between their lips. It was the genius of Howard Hawks, who directed, to do everything possible to make Humphrey Bogart a matinée idol, including having Lauren Bacall slump down in the car seat so as not to tower over him. With this movie a new kind of cinematic hero was created, the existential PI, a seemingly ordinary looking guy gifted with street smarts and easy courage, admired by men, and adored by women.Hawks fashioned this, part of the Bogart legend, with a noire script penned by William Faulkner, et al., adapted from Raymond Chandler's first novel, that sparkled with spiffy lines, intriguing characters, danger and a not entirely serious attention to plot detail. Hawks surrounded Bogey with admiring dames, beginning with the sexy Martha Vickers who tries to jump into his lap while he's still standing (as Marlowe tells General Sternwood), and ending with the incomparable Lauren Bacall, looking beguiling, beautiful and mysteriously seductive. In fact, every female in the cast wants to get her hands on Bogey, including a quick and easy Dorothy Malone, bored in her specs while clerking at a book store. Hawks also employed some very fine character actors, most notably Elisa Cook Jr., and Bob Steele, the former as always, the little guy crook, (Harry Jones), and the latter, as often seen in westerns, the mindless heavy with a gun (Canino). Charles Waldron played the world-weary general and Charles D. Brown was the butler.I was reminded somehow of the old Charlie Chan movies with the dark, mysterious, ornately-decorated interiors heavily carpeted and studded with ethnic statuettes, especially the house on Laverne Terrace that Bogey keeps coming back to, and the glass-paned doors and glass-separated cubicals of his office and others. The atmospheric L.A. created here has been much admired and imitated, cf., Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), two very superior movies that continued the tradition.In comparing this to the book, I have to say it's a little on the white-washed side, and not as clearly drawn--'confused' some have said. Of course liberties were taken with Chandler's novel to make it romantic. Chandler's novel emphasizes cynicism, and romance takes a back seat to manliness and loyalty to the client. An especially striking difference is in the character of General Sternwood's younger daughter, Carmen. She is vividly drawn in the book as something of monster, a degenerate sex kitten who would try and do just about anything. She is twice encountered butt naked by Marlowe, once in his bed. Being the sterling guy he is, he turns her away. (Right. I could do that.) Another difference is in all the sleazy details about the low-life underworld of Los Angeles that are omitted or glossed over in the film, including Geiger's homosexuality and his gay house guest, Carol Lundgren. (Of course there was a code in those days.) Bacall's character in the movie is actually a fusion of Vivian and Mona Mars from the book, made nice for movie fans. In the book, Marlowe kisses Vivian, but turns down her invitation for more intimate contact. In the movie, of course, there is no way Bogart is going to say 'no' to Bacall. In the book Marlowe seems to prefer whiskey to women.Most of the sharp dialogue comes right from Chandler's novel, including Bogart's grinning line, 'Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains.' Interesting is the little joke on Bogart in the opening scene. In the novel, Chandler's hero is greeted by the purring Carmen with the words, 'Tall, aren't you?' Well, the one thing Bogey ain't is tall, and so in the movie Carmen says, 'You're not very tall, are you?' Bogart comes back with, 'I try to be.' In the novel, Marlowe says, 'I didn't mean to be.'By the way, the film features Bacall singing a forties tune and looking mighty good doing it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

230,The Hateful Eight,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3381183/,"I'm a Tarantino fan, but this film was difficult to process. I hear some people say he ""..broke the rules by creating 3 hour plus film"" or ""..glorious cinema"" - all in the context of being good. For me, and this is my subjective opinion, is this film is bad. First, I do not know why Tarantino needed 3 hours to make this film. The storyline was excessive. It feels more like a 3 hour student reel of 70mm cinematography. In the real wild west, they would have simply shot the bounty hunter, not spend hours planting guns, giving up their *own* guns, cooking, making a fire, and poisoning the coffee. I believe that for me, the story dialogue alone killed the movie. It is simply unrealistic. What in the world was up with the sole female in the movie being 'facialized' with spit, punches, blood, vomit, and brains? It almost felt like Tarantino had his heart broke and took it out on this character via film. And heck, watching the movie felt like reading Huckleberry Finn, with ""nigger' in almost all the dialogue. Sure, this is a common trait in many dark films, but damn, it sorta was excessive in this film. Not in a bad way (well slightly), but in a way that it just didn't work. Tarantino has spoken about using his film to *correct* injustices of the past. This is notable in his films; Django - a hero slave who frees other slaves and whips the white man and Inglorious Bastards - kill Nazis. I think Tarantino squeezed some of that Tarantino justice in the Hateful Eight, by showing S. Jackson forcing the head of a helpless White man to deep throat his penis. I love recurring actors in a director's film, but I think this film killed that spirit, at least for me. Man, the actors in this film appeared lethargic, almost as if they were tired in appearing in another Tarantino film. Well, S. Jackson appeared the most peppy. I believe this film is almost made for film/cinema/camera buffs; the general audience may not appreciate some cinematic elements in the film. What is holding this movie on the likability scale is the 70mm use, but using it for this particular story and its narrative was a waste. This is a slooooooooooow movie. The 3 hours is a testament. But I don't know. I think it's simply a combination of elements that made this movie bad: the acting that appeared fake/tired, the long ass story, the story itself, and the dialogue. My brain just didn't process it and regurgitated the film. I really wanted to love this film. It simply didn't happen. But does it matter?

231,The Hateful Eight,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3449366/,"You'd have to go back 80 years or so to the film adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End to find a film where the set qualifies as a living participant of the action. The house in the adaption of the Eugene O'Neill classic Long Day's Journey Into Night also qualifies here.The action is set up when the stagecoach where bounty hunter Kurt Russell is taking his prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh to the town of Red Rock to be hung. A couple of prairie hitchhikers also come on board another bounty hunter Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins son of a former Confederate general who says he's the new sheriff in the town of Red Rock. Kurt Russell replete with full flowing beard and mustache is one suspicious man. He has those suspicions justified before the film is ended.80% of the action takes place on set of the 19th century bed and breakfast during the time of a nasty Wyoming winter and does the dialog crackle.

Hateful is the operating word with these characters, there's nothing really noble about any of them.Besides the set of Minnie's Haberdashery to recommend it, Quentin Tarrantino selected a truly fine ensemble cast who play beautifully off each other. As the outlaw queen Jennifer Jason Leigh got a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but in my humble opinion she doesn't stand out any more than any of the rest of them.

233,I Saw the Devil,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2340738/,"Whenever I see a negative review of ""I Saw the Devil"", the critic always mentions (scornfully) that the movie is ultra violent and portrays women in horrifying circumstances. Yes it is, and yes it does.But this isn't a Hollywood slasher flick. The kills in this movie are not gratifying and aren't meant to be. The women being killed are not scantily clad models running through forests from men wearing masks. There is nothing pleasant or ""cool"" about these scenes; they make the viewer uncomfortable, they unsettle, they bring one's mind into very dark places. It gives us a peek into the madness that every man is capable of, and does so realistically and without pulling its punches. This brutal realism makes people uncomfortable, and prompts negative reviews. This is understandable, but unfortunate. I believe that a movie should be judged on more than the amount of blood the viewer is comfortable seeing on-screen. To these people, please, do not watch Korean revenge thrillers if you are uncomfortable with torture or blood.But enough of that rambling. This movie is excellent. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark, dimly lit scenes where the murders, or gritty fight scenes, occur. The camera work is simple but effective; the viewer is often treated to close-ups of both Byung-hun Lee and Mik-sik Choi, and their facial expressions tell us more than dialogue ever could. There is also contrast between Lee and Choi. Lee, clean and stoic, and Choi, filthy and madly expressive. They compliment each other very well, and play off of each others strengths effectively.The story itself is typical of revenge films, but fantastic in its execution. Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character, and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between ""victim"" and ""aggressor"" becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in ""I Saw the Devil""; the viewer is left with shades of grey.As for the acting, it was all done very well. As I mentioned, Lee and Choi work well together, and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner, shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger, but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive, but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.As for flaws, the only thing I can think of is the strange, perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS, and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden, but that shouldn't make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still, though, it's a very trivial complaint that isn't worth a deducted point.A confident 10/10 from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically, and are able to appreciate more than just gore, please, do yourself a favour and watch this film.",positive,"[['a negative review', 'Devil', 'the movie', 'ultra violent'], ['Hollywood', 'slasher', 'flick'], ['this movie'], [], ['nothing', 'pleasant', 'the viewer', 'mind'], ['a peek', 'the madness', 'every man'], ['This brutal realism'], [], ['a movie', 'the amount', 'blood', 'the viewer'], ['please', 'Korean', 'revenge', 'torture', 'that rambling'], ['This movie'], ['Beautiful cinematography', 'the stark', 'lit', 'gritty fight', 'occur'], ['The camera', 'work', 'the viewer', 'Byung-hun Lee', 'Mik-sik Choi', 'dialogue'], ['contrast', 'Lee', 'Choi'], ['Lee', 'stoic', 'Choi', 'filthy'], ['story', 'revenge', 'execution'], ['Lee', 'character', 'a profound loss', 'Choi', 'character', 'the process', 'revenge', 'the man'], ['The line', 'victim', 'aggressor'], ['the film'], ['Devil', 'the viewer', 'grey.As', 'the acting'], ['Lee', 'Choi', 'an excellent job'], ['Choi', 'character', 'convincing manner', 'calmness', 'anger', 'a way'], ['Lee', 'character', 'emotion', 'body'], ['A memorable performance', 'the only thing', 'unrealistic behaviour', 'the police'], ['Lee', 'a member', 'NIS', 'police', 'the wrong side', 'the street'], ['trivial complaint', 'a deducted point.A'], ['serial murder', 'gore', 'please', 'a favour', 'this film']]","[['negative review', 'Devil', 'mentions', 'movie', 'ultra violent', 'portrays women', 'circumstances'], ['Hollywood slasher flick'], ['kills', 'movie'], ['women', 'clad models', 'forests from men', 'masks'], ['nothing pleasant', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'mind', 'dark places'], ['peek', 'madness', 'man', 'punches'], ['brutal realism', 'people', 'prompts', 'negative reviews'], [], ['movie', 'amount of blood', 'viewer'], ['people', 'please', 'Korean revenge thrillers', 'torture', 'rambling'], ['movie'], ['Beautiful cinematography', 'stark', 'lit scenes', 'murders', 'fight scenes', 'occur'], ['camera work', 'viewer', 'close-ups', 'Byung-hun Lee', 'Mik-sik Choi', 'facial expressions', 'dialogue'], ['contrast between Lee', 'Choi'], ['Lee', 'stoic', 'Choi', 'filthy'], ['others', 'story', 'revenge films', 'execution'], ['Lee', 'character', 'profound loss', 'hands of Choi', 'character', 'process', 'revenge', 'man'], ['line', 'victim', 'aggressor', 'becomes', 'characters'], ['film shines'], ['Devil', 'viewer', 'shades of grey.As', 'acting'], ['Lee and Choi', 'members', 'excellent job'], ['Choi', 'character', 'convincing manner', 'calmness', 'anger', 'way'], ['Lee', 'character', 'amounts of emotion', 'eyes', 'subtle movements', 'body'], ['memorable performance', 'flaws', 'only thing', 'unrealistic behaviour', 'police'], ['Lee', 'member', 'NIS', 'police officers', 'wrong side', 'street'], ['trivial complaint', 'deducted point.A'], ['serial murder', 'gore', 'please', 'favour', 'film']]"

235,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2536083/,"Here is a rundown of the differences in the two movies:-MIKAEL BLOMKVIST-American - Blomkvist is played as more of a tough guy and not a good guy. His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more detached than emotional.Swedish - This is the ""good guy"" side of Mikael. He is sensitive, caring, and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth. Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn't look as sturdy as his American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes between them in the Swedish version. -LISBETH SALANDER-American - Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude, aggression, and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.Swedish - In this version Lisbeth is not shy, not gentle, and not nice. She doesn't chase Blomkvist - he chases her. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. Her dragon tattoo is much, much better.-OVERALL- I liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth. While I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version, such as the ending, overall I enjoyed the American version more. On the flip side, I can understand why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite character and she's been changed into something they don't like. For me, the modifications to Lisbeth's character weren't severe enough to put me off.The Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies that have a raw intensity to them.

236,Captain Phillips,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5183289/,"Based on a true story, this film is a dramatization of the 2009 hijacking of an American ship by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean. The title character is played by Tom Hanks.The beginning has its flaws. It takes a while to get used to the busy hand-held camera work. It also gives the impression of being yet another ""us vs. them"" / ""good guys vs. bad guys"" scenario that has been done hundreds of times before, particularly those based on true stories.Last year's ""Argo"" advanced this genre from its superb directing despite its great stretching of the truth.

237,Captain Phillips,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2944658/,"That went a lot higher than my expectations. I was thinking an okay movie, but that was more than just okay. Truly impressive powerful thriller.The movie's strength points could be summed up:1. Greengrass's thrillers are really fine, I like his The Bourne Ultimatum with his shaky camera tricks. And here he is doing it again maybe with different techniques. As a thriller, Greengrass managed to make this movie get on your nerves and put so much tension, and that's a success.2. The Somali crew.. Now, that's some serious impressive sh*t. Some Somali dudes you have never seen their faces in a movie before come and make such spectacular performances, that's something you should admire. It made the movie so believable that you'd sometimes forget it's just a movie. Barkhad Abdi has made a huge step in his career with this movie and that was crowned by his nomination for the best actor in a supporting role. He probably won't get it, but he deserved it.3. Tom Hanks is just a really fine actor. He was driving the whole thing with his convincing performance. I still can't believe he got my tearing in that scene, or let's just say crying. Greengrass has taken him to squeeze some fine acting skills.4. Fair screenplay that didn't make you forget that justice should be done, no matter how the conditions the person lives in, but it also pushed the eyes to take a look into the world that would produce such people as pirates.",positive,"[['a lot'], ['an okay movie'], ['impressive powerful thriller.The movie', 'strength'], ['Greengrass', 'Bourne Ultimatum', 'shaky camera'], [], ['a thriller', 'Greengrass', 'this movie', 'much tension', 'a success.2'], ['Somali', 'some serious impressive sh', '*', 'Somali', 'a movie', 'come', 'something'], ['the movie', 'a movie'], ['Barkhad Abdi', 'a huge step', 'career', 'this movie', 'nomination', 'actor', 'a supporting role'], ['it.3'], ['Tom Hanks', 'fine actor'], ['the whole thing', 'performance'], ['tearing', 'that scene'], ['Greengrass', 'some fine acting skills.4'], ['Fair', 'justice', 'no matter', 'the person', 'a look', 'the world']]","[['lot', 'expectations'], ['okay movie'], ['impressive powerful thriller.The movie', 'strength points'], ['Greengrass', 'thrillers', 'Bourne Ultimatum', 'camera tricks'], ['different techniques'], ['thriller', 'Greengrass', 'movie', 'nerves', 'much tension', 'success.2'], ['Somali', 'sh *', 'Somali dudes', 'movie before come', 'such spectacular performances', 'something'], ['movie', 'movie'], ['Barkhad Abdi', 'huge step', 'career', 'movie', 'nomination', 'actor', 'supporting role'], ['it.3'], ['Tom Hanks', 'fine actor'], ['whole thing', 'performance'], ['tearing', 'scene'], ['Greengrass', 'fine acting skills.4'], ['Fair', 'justice', 'matter', 'conditions', 'person', 'eyes', 'look', 'world', 'people as pirates']]"

Filmed in a delicate black and white, The White Ribbon takes place in a small German town in the immediate period before World War I. Through a number of mysterious violent acts occurring in the village, Haneke wants to show the hypocrisy of a society rigidly stratified by class. Haneke refuses either to give a clear explanation of these acts (though they turn out to be carried out by children of the community) or to follow a clear narrative line. These make the movie more irritating than surprising (though there always will be snobs that will claim that we are in front of a masterpiece). Some reviewers have claimed the movie to be some sort of metaphor for the birth of National Socialism (with the children supposedly turning into Nazis 25 years later), but there is really nothing here about this.

241,The White Ribbon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2128556/,"Admittedly, I was underwhelmed at its conclusion. I knew it was something great, especially in construction and visual prowess, yet I couldn't shake that feeling of clouded mediocrity. And then, after talking about it with my friend for an hour or two afterwards, it hit me. Haneke has intentionally filled our minds with detail upon detail, setting up conspiracies and unsolved mysterious, leading us to believe things only to plant clues that refute them. Looking back, I found that each second stuck in my head; I couldn't shake even the minutest detail because it might hold the key to solving this puzzle. Deaths, tragedies, and accidents are happening every day, possibly connected, but how? Our narrator, the town's schoolteacher played by Christian Friedel, is relaying the events that occurred before being sent off to fight once the Archduke Ferdinand is assassinated. He believes the strange attitude and mysterious activities all began with a freak accident of the doctor. Riding his horse back home, he is thrown off when its legs trip on a wire spanning two trees, causing a lengthy hospital stay to recover. Next come a death, a kidnapping, and a beating, all unsolved despite hunches and hypotheses going through the town. Something is in the air, but what it is and what will come of it is unknown.The children are the key to everything. They are the easiest to blame, as it seems they are always there by the tragedies. Definitely hiding something, the kids begin to stare authority in the eye and practice what has been preached. Haneke mentions in an interview attached to the press notes that he wanted to show the sort of ""black"" education going on at the time, breeding Fascism and terror. Good and evil fall to strict black and white, every action has a reaction, a punishment to set things right. The children are of an age that they are beginning to understand that life is not eternal, there are consequences in their actions and the adults are not afraid to tell them so. When you don't follow the rules, you will be caned, (a brilliant scene showing the young siblings enter the room, but allowing the audience to only see the closed door during the abuse), and you will have to wear the white ribbon in order to show the world your transgressions and need to earn back the right to be free, (the precursor to the Jewish stars perhaps?).What about the adults? What about those practicing adultery, or abuse of power, or destruction of property, or sexual abuse with a child? Who has the right to punish them? When, after the second kidnapping and beating of a young boy, a note is found stating intentions, that the children of transgressors will be discipline for four to five generations, you start to see the severity of the actions—as well as allusions to the Holocaust and the mass genocide of an entire people, rooting out the ""evils"" of the world by excising the entire population, killing the bloodline at the source. But it can't be the children, right? They are too young and innocent, unknowing of the world set before them. Yet with the upbringing in this town, treated as adults with responsibilities and accountability, anyone would grow up fast. Cause a raucous in class and be chastised; be the leader and stand in the corner. Forgiveness is a liability. When the oldest girl, and leader of the wolves if you believe the children are the monsters, Klara, (wonderfully portrayed by Maria-Victoria Dargus), is ready to accept Communion, her own father, the pastor, (a menacing man of authority realized by Burghart Klaussner), pauses, contemplating whether she deserves it. You know he doesn't want to give in, family bond means nothing.Haneke has woven a tapestry of intrigue that will keep you on edge throughout. The anticipation of a solution is palpable, and the fact it is never released makes this film so riveting and unforgettable. The payoff is that these children will grow up into the generation that becomes the Nazi party, making this sleepy rural town a breeding ground for young Fascists that will change the world. Retribution is being taught, atoning for ones sins practiced. World War II is after all an answer to the punishment inflicted on Germany after the first, isn't it? It's a cycle of getting back, proving one's pride, and seeking revenge upon the children of the enemy if the enemy itself is unavailable. God's will has to be upheld and that intrinsic fact is ingrained in the minds of the youth. When Martin, an effective Leonard Proxauf, is discovered walking along the railing of a high bridge, he responds to the yelling of the man that finds him with the line used to title this review. If what he was doing was wrong—we can only infer on his role in the incidents occurring around him—then God would have let him fall, paying for his sins. But the fact that he gets to the other side unscathed only proves his work is that of the creator of man. Haneke says he had another name for the film, God's Right Hand, and I think it would have been just as appropriate a title. A powerful film, sharing so much information without any answers; it takes our mind into overdrive, trying so hard to find a reason for it all. But sometimes there are none; sometimes bad things just happen. You can only speculate and hope to prevent them from ever happening again.",positive,"[['conclusion'], ['something', 'construction', 'visual prowess', 'feeling', 'clouded mediocrity'], ['friend', 'an

And Ridley Scott makes him seem like a businessman who just happens to be moving cocaine and heroine.And the real tragedy of it all, was that Frank Lucas only got 7 years in prison, instead of the 70 years, he was sentenced to serve. Because he testified against cops that took bribes from him. And now, because of the movie he sees himself as a hero and a star. And that's how the audience will sea him as well.

247,American Gangster,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2675332/,"American Gangster is a biographical crime film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Steve Zaillian. The film is based on the criminal career of Frank Lucas, a gangster from La Grange, North Carolina who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the Vietnam War. It features Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in leading roles,together with John Ortiz, Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Ruby Dee, and Lymari Nadal in supporting roles.There was a time when no one noticed reserved driver Frank Lucas, but when the criminal kingpin he was charged with transporting through the city streets suddenly dies, Lucas seizes the opportunity to build his own criminal empire. In the following months, Lucas solidifies his status as Harlem's most innovative drug dealer by delivering a product that is purer than the competitors' and cheaper, as well. When innovative businessman Lukas attempts to go semi-legit by becoming one of the Manhattan borough's biggest civil supporters, however, street- savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts begins to sense a sizable shift in the hierarchy of the drug underworld. But Roberts is one of the few honest detectives operating within a corrupt system, and as he sets out to investigate the case, crooked detective Trupo does everything in his power to compromise the integrity of his idealistic counterpart. Upon clearing all of the usual Mafia-connected suspects, Roberts begins to believe that a previously unknown black power player has come out of the woodwork to dominate the local drug trade. While Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues. Now, as a confrontation between the two men becomes inevitable and the fate of each becomes inexorably tied to the other, it gradually becomes apparent that only one of them will emerge from the conflict victorious.American Gangster an epic, true crime drama, that although not entirely original in its premise is excellent in its execution.It maybe long at 157 minutes but immerses its audience with its twists and intricacies as it plays out and considers the logistics and consequences of crime and police corruption, with a plethora of show-stealing performances from the cast especially Washington's steely grip on his impersonation of Frank Lucas.",positive,"[['American Gangster', 'a biographical crime', 'film', 'Ridley Scott', 'Steve Zaillian'], ['The film', 'the criminal career', 'Frank Lucas', 'a gangster', 'La Grange', 'North Carolina', 'heroin', 'United', 'American', 'service', 'Vietnam War'], ['Denzel Washington', 'Russell Crowe', 'John Ortiz', 'Josh Brolin', 'Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Norman Reedus', 'Ruby Dee', 'Lymari Nadal', 'roles.There', 'a time', 'no one', 'Frank Lucas', 'the criminal kingpin', 'the city', 'Lucas', 'the opportunity', 'own criminal empire'], ['Lucas', 'status', 'Harlem', 'innovative drug', 'dealer', 'a product'], ['innovative businessman', 'Lukas', 'Manhattan', 'borough', 'street- savvy', 'outcast', 'cop', 'Ritchie Roberts', 'a sizable shift', 'the hierarchy', 'the drug', 'underworld'], ['Roberts', 'the few honest', 'a corrupt system', 'the case', 'Trupo', 'everything', 'power', 'the integrity', 'idealistic counterpart'], ['Roberts', 'unknown black power', 'player', 'the woodwork', 'the local drug', 'trade'], ['Lucas', 'the law', 'thing', 'a strict code'], ['a confrontation', 'the fate', 'the conflict', 'Gangster', 'an epic', 'true crime', 'drama', 'premise', 'execution.It', 'audience', 'crime', 'police', 'corruption', 'a plethora', 'the cast', 'Washington', 'steely grip', 'impersonation', 'Frank Lucas']]","[['American Gangster', 'crime film', 'Ridley Scott', 'Steve Zaillian'], ['film', 'career of Frank Lucas', 'gangster from La Grange', 'North Carolina', 'heroin', 'United States', 'American service planes', 'Vietnam War'], ['Denzel Washington', 'Russell Crowe', 'roles', 'John Ortiz', 'Josh Brolin', 'Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Norman Reedus', 'Ruby Dee', 'Lymari Nadal', 'roles.There', 'time', 'one', 'Frank Lucas', 'criminal kingpin', 'city', 'dies', 'Lucas', 'opportunity', 'own criminal empire'], ['following months', 'Lucas', 'status as Harlem', 'drug dealer', 'product', 'competitors'], ['businessman Lukas attempts', 'Manhattan borough', 'civil supporters', 'savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts', 'sizable shift', 'hierarchy', 'drug underworld'], ['Roberts', 'honest detectives', 'corrupt system', 'case', 'detective Trupo', 'everything', 'power', 'integrity', 'idealistic counterpart'], ['usual Mafia-connected suspects', 'Roberts', 'power player', 'woodwork', 'drug trade'], ['Roberts and Lucas', 'opposite sides', 'law', 'thing', 'men', 'code of ethics', 'opportunistic colleagues'], ['confrontation', 'men', 'fate', 'becomes', 'conflict', 'victorious.American Gangster', 'epic', 'crime drama', 'premise', 'execution.It', 'minutes', 'audience', 'twists and intricacies', 'logistics', 'consequences of crime', 'police corruption', 'plethora', 'show-stealing performances', 'cast', 'Washington', 'steely grip', 'impersonation of Frank Lucas']]"

250,Hot Fuzz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1593241/,"Hot Fuzz marks the long awaited return of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's partnership to the big screen. Shaun of the Dead left them with a very hard act to follow but Hot Fuzz easily achieves expectations and possibly even exceeds its predecessor. And the team stay close to their roots with plenty of in jokes and sly nods to other films to keep their core fan base happy. And of course there is the inevitable who's who of British comedy showing up in various roles throughout the film, most memorably Bill Bailey. Although I have to say I was sad to see that Dylan Moran and Jessica Stevenson were absent.The film tells the story of Nicholas Angel, an overachieving supercop from London who is making the rest of his department look bad through his diligent dedication to the job. Cue him being shipped off to a quiet Gloucestershire village, Sandford. Angel does not fit in with the local constabulary, who prefer to eat cake and drink excessively rather than do any police work. When lots of 'accidents' start happening around the village they are dismissive of Angel's claims that there is more to them than meets the eye and leave him to investigate and piece together the details on his own.The story works well, slowly piecing together what's going on and there are various twists and turns along the way, if nothing too extravagant. The action set-pieces also work well, carefully treading that thin line between comic and just plain ridiculous. There are one-liners aplenty, as to be expected, and this will be another endlessly quoted film I'm sure (not that I can remember any at this point in time, I'm useless like that!). There is also an inspired take on THAT fence jumping scene from Shaun of the Dead.Some brilliant characters are introduced in Hot Fuzz. Olivia Colman's character PC Doris has to be one of the highlights, every time she speaks it raises a laugh. It is also good to see Simon Pegg playing a different character from his usual geeky, lovable layabout. Nick Frost again proves his worth as PC Danny, who is more concerned with cop movies than actual police work. Other classics are the proper Gloucestershire copper who needs translating into English, the sly Andy's detectives and a recurring swan..All-in-all hats off to Simon, Edgar and team for managing to keep the standard up with their second film, especially with it not being as obvious a target for them as the zombie movie. I wasn't sure how it was going to work them tackling this genre but they have done an excellent job. Let's hope they continue their magic with other themes, maybe a revenge movie?

251,Hot Fuzz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1646810/,"Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets-of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous.",positive,"[['Hot Fuzz', 'American action', 'a way', 'an American satire'], ['Edgar Wright', 'Simon Pegg', 'the plot', 'the car'], ['Hollywood', 'formula', 'the scene', 'Point Break', 'Keanu', 'gun', 'the sky', 'anger', 'the scene', 'Bad Boys II', 'Martin Lawrence', 'a circling', 'shot', 'S * * *'], ['Hollywood', 'action', 'Nick Frost'], ['The film', 'precise tune', 'the American mainstream', 'action', 'adventure.The', 'irony', 'this film', 'place', 'beautiful English countryside'], ['the film'], ['English', 'English', 'village', 'life'], ['brilliant element', 'Hot Fuzz', 'the intertwining', 'a big-budget action', 'film', 'fast pace', 'a quaint', 'English', 'village', 'the secrets-of-its-own flavor', 'Agatha', 'Christie-style expository', 'structure.The film-making style', 'the satire'], ['The cinematography', 'editing', 'a product', 'the school', 'Tony Scott', 'Guy Ritchie'], ['jump', 'loud', 'occasional strobe', 'grainy', 'machine', 'gun', 'speed'], ['The soundtrack', 'any super-cool action', 'film', 'Hollywood'], ['a dead-on impression', 'Hollywood', 'film-making', 'a hilarious opposition', 'English', 'countryside.Simon', 'Pegg', 'performance', 'a work', 'comic genius'], ['character', 'a man', 'authentic confidence', 'incredible drive', 'a workaholic', 'a zealot', 'an action', 'hero', 'stereotype'], ['Nick Frost', 'a great second banana', 'the punchline', 'Pegg', 'straight line', 'adolescent way', 'an unlikely comic relief', 'sidekick.The', 'film', 'great surprise', 'a comeback performance', 'Timothy Dalton'], ['a reappearance', 'the abyss', 'two-year stint', 'James Bond', 'a vindication', 'credibility', 'an actor', 'comic ability'], ['the film', 'great highlights.I', 'a comedy']]","[['Hot Fuzz', 'action films', 'way', 'American satire'], ['Edgar Wright', 'Simon Pegg', 'plot threads', 'car chases'], ['details of Hollywood', 'formula', 'continuous references', 'scene in Point Break', 'Keanu', 'gun', 'sky in anger', 'scene in Bad Boys II', 'Martin Lawrence', 'circling', 'shot', 'S * * *'], ['characteristics of Hollywood', 'portray people', 'scenes in action movies', 'Nick Frost'], ['film', 'precise tune', 'mainstream action adventure.The irony', 'film', 'place', 'beautiful English countryside'], ['ways', 'film', 'Americans'], ['conscious social mannerisms', 'English', 'English village life'], ['element of Hot Fuzz', 'intertwining', 'action film', 'gimmicks', 'fast pace', 'quaint', 'English village', 'secrets-of-its-own flavor', 'Agatha', 'Christie-style expository', 'structure.The film-making style', 'satire'], ['cinematography and editing', 'product', 'school of Tony Scott', 'Guy Ritchie'], ['jump cuts', 'loud', 'sound effects', 'occasional strobe', 'montages of grainy', 'lit shots', 'machine gun speed'], ['soundtrack', 'action film', 'Hollywood'], ['impression of Hollywood film-making', 'hilarious opposition', 'English countryside.Simon Pegg', 'performance', 'work', 'comic genius'], ['character', 'man', 'authentic confidence', 'incredible drive', 'workaholic', 'zealot', 'action hero stereotype'], ['Nick Frost', 'great second banana', 'punchline', 'Pegg', 'straight line', 'adolescent way', 'relief sidekick.The film', 'great surprise', 'performance from Timothy Dalton'], ['reappearance', 'abyss', 'stint as James Bond', 'vindication', 'credibility', 'actor', 'comic ability'], ['film', 'great highlights.I', 'comedy']]"
252,Serenity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1184982/,"I first became interested in FIREFLY, the series, and SERENITY, through the early trailers shown back in May. AFter seeing the trailer I rented the series, loved it, and since purchasing the DVD have seen it many times. I really looked forward to the movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the trailer and was mediocre at best. None of the elements that made the series so enjoyable are present. Gone are deep character development and the lively interaction among the crew members. Book and Inara are really just cameos,while Kaylee, Wash, and even Simon have little to do. The heart of FIREFLY was the relationship between Simon and River, but it's little explored here. Humor and hints of romance are, for the most part, absent. The plot is action-heavy and really is just the crew trying to escape from Reavers. The entire rationale behind the Alliance's desperate need to eliminate River Tam is uninteresting and the explanation for the existence of the Reavers is truly lame. It was much more interesting to have the Reavers be humans who'd gone wild on the outer rim. I kept waiting for the ""two-by-two, hands-of-blue"" creeps to show up but they never did. Finally, the operative's bizarre about-face at the end makes no sense. Seeing this poor feature film makes me love the FIREFLY series even more. I was hooked at the end of the first half, when Mal opens up the crate carrying River.

253,Serenity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1152837/,"The others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare, but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience, this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us, with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars, and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to, although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship, though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home, and that's what the ship represents to them, and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion, the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning, but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about (and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them, and I cared just as much for that than any of them). The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year, and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released, and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas, and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone, and even in the core of the geek fandom, the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50, uber-geeks and ""cool"" types, and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages.

254,Crash,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1197173/,"I saw this ""movie"" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at Netflix, and from it I leaned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson I learned is ""Don't trust reviews"".Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they DO see it. The only reason that I can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking, or who've seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called ""Racism For Dummies"", as emotionally wrenching as possible, seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it's not... An after-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection.It's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme, simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's face it people. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). It's well acted (even if the dialog is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much that you don't think to ask ""where's the beef?"" until you can tell the film is winding down. The flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end. The messages are very heavy-handed, and from the ""behind the scenes"" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the ""Blood on the Highway"" of racism. They could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the ""side-nude"" shot of Jennifer Esposito.In this film, everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson (except for Michael Pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline).This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.",negative,"[['movie', 'the sheer', 'number', 'Netflix', 'a valuable lesson'], ['a lesson', 'ethnic diversity', 'the lesson', '.Yes', 'racism', 'this movie', 'drawn'], ['The only reason', 'the number', 'first thought-provoking movie', 'somehow', 'Haggis', 'the concept'], ['fact', 'this film', 'Racism', 'a lot', 'time', 'the impression', 'some fundamental truth', 'a film'], ['Zen', 'Art', 'Motorcycle Maintanence', 'An after-school special', 'much introspection.It', 'everyone', 'possible extreme'], [], ['NOBODY', 'all cardboard'], ['the dialog', 'the beef'], ['the film'], ['The flaming', 'car', 'scene', 'the movie', 'the end'], ['blurb', 'a different movie', 'this movie', 'funny'], ['NOT', 'entertainment', 'a high school', 'diversity', 'lesson', 'call', 'Blood', 'Highway', 'racism'], ['shot', 'Jennifer Esposito.In', 'this film', 'everyone', 'a jerk', 'everyone', 'a lesson', 'Michael Pena', 'role', 'predictable storyline', '.This', 'a bad film', 'bad writing', 'cartoon', 'Paul Haggis', 'anything', 'a picture', 'crayons.Crash', 'a depressing little nothing', 'emotion', 'nothing', 'racism', 'prejudice']]","[['movie', 'sheer number', 'reviews at Netflix', 'valuable lesson'], ['lesson', 'ethnic diversity', 'lesson', 'reviews', '.Yes', 'racism sucks', 'people', 'people', 'movie', 'ones', 'drawn'], ['only reason', 'number', 'good reviews', 'people', 'first thought-provoking movie and somehow', 'Haggis', 'concept'], ['fact', 'film', 'Racism For Dummies', 'people', 'lot of time', 'impression', 'fundamental truth', 'film'], ['Zen', 'Art of Motorcycle Maintanence', 'after-school special', 'unthinking masses', 'bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces', 'much introspection.It', 'everyone', 'possible extreme', 'such good people', 'characters'], ['people'], ['NOBODY identifies', 'characters', 'cardboard cutouts', 'stereotypes', 'reverse-stereotypes'], ['dialog', 'beef'], ['film'], ['flaming car scene', 'movie', 'end'], ['messages', 'scenes', 'blurb', 'producers', 'different movie', 'movie', 'funny parts'], ['NOT entertainment', 'school diversity lesson', 'call', 'Blood', 'Highway', 'racism'], ['high schools', 'shot of Jennifer Esposito.In', 'film', 'everyone', 'jerk and everyone', 'lesson', 'Michael Pena', 'role', 'predictable storyline', '.This', 'bad film', 'bad writing', 'good actors', 'cartoon', 'Paul Haggis', 'people', 'anything', 'bold strokes', 'picture', 'crayons.Crash', 'depressing little nothing', 'emotion', 'teaches', 'nothing', 'racism and prejudice', 'bad things']]"
255,Crash,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0930266/,"In a drama strikingly reminiscent in style and tone of P.T. Anderson's film Magnolia (1999), the narrative in Crash shifts between 5 or 6 different groups of seemingly unconnected characters, whose relationships to each other are only revealed in the end.Not to be confused with the David Cronenberg feature of the same name, this Crash is the feature-length, studio-released directorial debut of veteran Canadian TV writer/producer/director and two-time Emmy-winner Paul Haggis. An in-depth exploration on the themes of racism and prejudice, cause and effect, chance and coincidence, and tragedy, ""crash"" is a metaphor for the collisions between strangers in the course of day-to-day existence. Set over a 24-hour period in contemporary L.A., it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city.Crash features a top-notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics.Centering around two disturbing car accidents, a carjacking, vicious workplace vandalism, and the suspicious shooting death of one police officer by another, the drama is set against the backdrop of a racist LAPD and Los Angeles justice system. Action shifts between the various characters, whose lives collide with each other in unpredictable ways as each faces their own moral dilemma, and tries to cope with the consequences of their resulting decision made or action taken. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking, common conclusion, which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling.Crash is backed by a solid and varied, original soundtrack and excellent cinematography. Sweeping, wider shots alternate with disjointed camera angles which convey the chaos and confusion of the characters and the unpredictability of life. Occasional lingering close-ups -- on occasion without sound -- capture the actors' facial expressions, which suitably detail key moments of the characters' aching pain, fear, anger, bitter anguish, remorse or grief, far better than any dialogue could.This breathtaking film is destined to be a critical smash and box-office hit.

I have to admit, having gone in with little expectation, i was flawed!  This was one of the better movies that i have seen in a long time.  Jim Caviezel's performance is slightly whiny to begin with, but in the context of the whole story, the reason therefore is appreciated and makes his transition and growth as a character that much more riveting to watch.  I absolutely loved him as Edmund Dantes then the dynamic Count of Monte Cristo and cannot have imagined a better choice.  He was definitely not bad on the eyes either.  Every scene had him looking more dashing and more handsome than the one before.Guy Pierce surprised me with a performance that was totally believable.  His dry humour only made him more appealing, very well acted.The entire epic, though long, never gives you the impression that you have been sitting still for ages.  It moves along swiftly and always had me gripped, from the action, suspense, and even to the humour that was evident from time to time.  The love story surprised me most of all.  Instead of taking on a highly sexual slant, as all these new films do, it was understated, the female lead doing an admirable job of portraying the wounded lover, who has always longed for her Edmund.  I loved the innocence that she managed to bring to the role, a really terrific actress and a really beautiful one as well.Wonderfully scripted, exceptionally carried out!

258,The Boondock Saints,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1383422/,"I guess it'll take a while for the effect to where off. I saw the unrated edition of ""The Boondock Saints"" two days ago and I'm still reeling in from the experience, which is surreal, to tell you the truth. Quite frankly, a movie that is this sharply written, acted, and directed is a true rarity these days. Writer-director Troy Duffy dives into the murkiest depths of the ""law,"" and its apparent futility in modern times, and how it takes two Irish fraternal twin brothers, Conner and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus - both of whom are a little too convincing in their roles), to stir up enough debate about vigilantism to become media heroes. The release of ""The Boondock Saints"" was sidelined in 1999 because of the Columbine massacre and the plot about Conner and Murphy being on a mission from God draws some eerie parallels to the motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day, Conner and Murphy get into a bar-room brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts. FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) shows up on the scene to show the local cops a thing or two about criminology and theorizes it was a revenge killing. Soon enough, both injured brothers waltz into the police station and claim self-defense. They're let off after a night in jail (plus experience a cathartic jail-cell baptism) and no charges filed. But soon, more bodies turn up, and Smecker learns that Conner and Murphy (and a third, David Della Rocco) may be the ones behind the mayhem on the streets. Duffy's film is a bloody one (most of the gruesome violence is extended in the unrated special edition), with a cackling screenplay that includes 246 uses of the f-word and assorted Irish-Euro-slang, and has earned a fearsome reputation in recent years and has been embraced as a cult phenomenon. (It's easy to see why, if one is a fan of relentless violence and bloodshed. P.S.: The action is so balletic in its style and excess that it's almost reminiscent of a John Woo picture.) I can't believe I stood away from this movie for so long, darn it! The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture. And still, there is a sense of beauty and tragedy underlying much of the action in ""The Boondock Saints,"" and its ending will certainly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some. Lastly, I would recommend reading up on as much about the controversy surrounding ""The Boondock Saints"" as one possibly can; it'll make the experience much more hypnotic.10/10",negative,"[['a while', 'the effect'], ['the unrated edition', 'Boondock', 'the experience', 'the truth'], ['a movie', 'a true rarity'], ['Writer-director Troy Duffy', 'law', 'apparent futility', 'Irish fraternal twin', 'Conner', 'Murphy', 'Sean Patrick Flanery', 'Norman Reedus', 'enough debate', 'vigilantism'], ['The release', 'Boondock', 'Columbine', 'massacre', 'the plot', 'Conner', 'Murphy', 'a mission', 'God', 'some eerie', 'Columbine', 'Eric Harris', 'Dylan Klebold'], ['the film', 'Boston', 'St. Patrick', 'Day', 'Conner', 'Murphy', 'a bar-room', 'brawl', 'a couple', 'the next morning', 'an alley', 'own blood'], ['FBI', 'agent', 'Paul Smecker', 'Willem Dafoe', 'the scene', 'a thing', 'criminology', 'a revenge', 'killing'], ['the police', 'station', 'claim', 'self-defense'], ['a night', 'jail', 'plus experience', 'a cathartic jail-cell', 'baptism'], ['Smecker', 'Conner', 'Murphy', 'David Della Rocco', 'the mayhem'], ['Duffy', 'film', 'the gruesome violence', 'the unrated special edition', 'screenplay', 'the f-word', 'Irish-Euro-slang', 'a fearsome reputation', 'a cult', 'phenomenon'], ['a fan', 'relentless violence'], ['P.S'], ['The action', 'style', 'excess', 'reminiscent', 'John Woo', 'picture'], ['this movie'], ['The opening', 'the action', 'a bit', 'the unrated version', 'quite bloody', 'a morbid sense', 'humor', 'the carnage', 'occasion', 'this picture'], ['a sense', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'the action', 'Boondock Saints', 'a bitter taste'], ['the controversy', 'Boondock Saints', 'possibly', 'the experience']]","[['while', 'effect'], ['unrated edition', 'Boondock Saints', 'days', 'experience', 'truth'], ['movie', 'true rarity', 'days'], ['Writer-director Troy Duffy', 'depths', 'law', 'apparent futility', 'modern times', 'twin brothers', 'Conner and Murphy', 'Sean Patrick Flanery', 'Norman Reedus', 'roles', 'debate about vigilantism', 'media heroes'], ['release', 'Boondock Saints', 'Columbine massacre', 'plot about Conner', 'Murphy', 'mission from God', 'eerie parallels', 'motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris', 'Dylan Klebold'], ['film', 'Boston after St. Patrick', 'Day', 'Conner and Murphy', 'bar-room brawl', 'couple', 'Russian toughs', 'toughs', 'next morning', 'alley in piles', 'own blood and guts'], ['FBI agent Paul Smecker', 'Willem Dafoe', 'scene', 'thing', 'criminology', 'revenge killing'], ['injured brothers', 'police station', 'claim self-defense'], ['night in jail', 'plus experience', 'jail-cell baptism', 'charges'], ['bodies', 'Smecker', 'Conner and Murphy', 'David Della Rocco', 'ones', 'mayhem', 'streets'], ['Duffy', 'film', 'gruesome violence', 'unrated special edition', 'screenplay', 'uses', 'f-word', 'assorted Irish-Euro-slang', 'fearsome reputation', 'recent years', 'cult phenomenon'], ['fan', 'relentless violence'], ['P.S'], ['action', 'style and excess', 'reminiscent', 'John Woo picture'], ['movie'], ['opening moments', 'action', 'bit', 'unrated version', 'quite bloody', 'sense of humor', 'carnage', 'occasion', 'picture'], ['sense of beauty', 'tragedy', 'action', 'Boondock Saints', 'bitter taste', 'mouths'], ['controversy', 'Boondock Saints', 'possibly', 'experience']]"

260,The Insider,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0528930/,"I have been a huge Michael Mann fan for years, but I do have to admit that I approached his latest film ""The Insider"" with just the teensiest bit of trepidation...after all, Mann is the godfather of the thinking man's action flick, and I've even heard it said that his action sequences are so integral to his movie that they are practically another character in the film...with which I completely agree.  So I was wondering how a movie with no chase sequence, no gunfights, basically no action whatsoever--well, how could that possibly qualify as an authentic Michael Mann signature film?Yes, the action, per se, is missing, but Mann still brings his signature directorial style to life with lots of wide shots, intense close ups, and indirect focus, all bathed in cool blue light and threaded together with an inventive soundtrack (including a reprise of a former track that was used so effectively in ""HEAT""; sorry, I can't recall the title offhand).And what the movie lacks in ""action"", Mann more than makes up for in high-wire tension.  He pulls us into the drama of an ordinary man's life by portraying the myriad humiliations, both large and small, that assault Wigand from the moment he is fired from his job as an R&D VP for a major tobacco company.  The detoriation of his life, from his finances to his marriage to his belief in himself, is explored with the sort of atmospheric detail that is Mann's trademark:  the play of light or lack of it; the familiar sights and sounds of everyday life, from the patterns of rain on a windshield to the rush of wind through the trees; and camera work that ranges from tight, out-of-focus shots to sweeping panoramas of razor-sharp clarity...all of this creates an environment of realism that puts you into the film.  You can't just observe Wigand's struggle; you experience it with him.  My movie-watching partner observed as we left the theatre that he felt exhausted from the tension, as if he'd just been through the corporate wringer himself.  I knew what he meant!But atmosphere isn't all Mann delivers.  Once again, this genius director has placed an unexpected actor in the lead role of his film, with amazing results.  Before Daniel Day Lewis was ""Nathaniel Poe"" in ""The Last of The Mohicans"", no one would have believed he could pull off a major hunk-o-rama role...well, guess what?  He ended up defining the hero of the adventure/romance genre!  In ""The Insider"", Mann has opted for the opposite effect, casting  young, potential hunk material Russell Crowe as an older, slightly-pot-bellied father of two.  Wigand doesn't look like anyone's hero, and perhaps that's actually the message of the movie:  an ordinary man--a nobody, really--caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  And Crowe delivers...in a major way!  Personally, I can't remember an acting performance that mesmerized me to this extent...unless it was the last time I watched Crowe, in ""L.A. Confidential"".  He evokes his character in this movie with the apparent ease of a magician doing card tricks:  the illusion is complete and appears to be effortless.  Even with silver, receding hair and twenty extra pounds which, we are shown, is not the result of costume padding, but Crowe's own amplified flesh, he is imminently watchable... almost hypnotically so.There are, even as I post this, whispers and rumors about this movie being an Oscar contender.  Best director, best actor, best supporting actor. Again, I can only nod my head in complete and total agreement.  Russell Crowe will blow you away, and Al Pacino gives his best performance in years.This film is quiet, intense, and ultimately, extremely moving.  I literally burst into tears twice, the way you do when you've recieved bad news or seen something dreadful, so complete was my empathy for the character of Jeffrey Wigand . The anger, helplessness, and puzzled confusion at being punished for telling the truth felt all too familiar to me.In summary, I was not at all disappointed in Mann's direction of this film. Even without the phenomenal action sequences he's known for, this film had the same visceral effect on me that I experienced when I saw Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, and HEAT.

261,The Insider,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0528736/,"I first wanted to see 'The Insider' because it professed to show the truth behind the lies of the Tobacco Industry. My wife and I saw it and were thoroughly impressed. In fact we've now seen it 5 times (I think, though I may have lost count).If you go to the movies to be entertained mindlessly, do NOT see this movie, you will bored. This movie is for people who like to think, and who like to receive superior presentation of thought provoking material. The Insider has all that.The movie gets you thinking about mankind. The obvious problem with human nature is obvious in this movie. The Tobacco companies knowingly selling addictive product, whilst claiming it is not. And then almost, almost but not quite, getting away with ruining an individual's life, an individual who's conscience was pricked by what they had seen.But then it moves into the CBS drama, where again the hopelessness of mankind in general shines through. The strength of two individuals though manages to win the day, which is what makes this true story so unusual.I found that (contrary to those who complained of the movies length) every scene that Mann has given us has a reason. A good reason. From the opening scenes depicting an evil far from USA. To the hints as to why we didn't hear anything about the drama when it happened, because the OJ murder story and media frenzy drowned out what should be to us all a much more serious matter.For me the crowning moment in the film was when Russell Crowe (as Wigand) was about to dig into a hamburger when behind him on TV a newscaster reported findings about him, bad (though unfounded) findings. Crowe put his knife and fork back down in a way that told us all that he had no more appetite, in fact all the will left in him had been violently thrust away, thrust away by the selfish interests of the Tobacco companies.All in all this is a complete movie that deserved its 7 nominations and should have gotten some awards. The sound was great, as was the camera work. If you love an artistic movie, you will love this one. Crowe is thoroughly believable and has cemented himself as a first rate actor, capable of playing just about any part put his way. Pacino is very well cast, Plummer is a class act, and a host of supporting cast did themselves proud.What we can't forget about this movie, for all its drama, and for the pointed view it gives us of the nature we bear, its a TRUE STORY. Thats what really makes it shocking.

The dialogue between Sofia and Cesar at first meeting and afterwards is so natural, so believable.  The four main characters are absolutely charming and have a rapport between each other that is rarely seen in films. This is either good casting or good acting, or maybe a bit of both.  As the story unfolds we are completely absorbed.  This is true entertainment on the highest level.  O.K. we may not be fully cognisant of what is happening at times, but we glue ourselves to the screen expecting that an explanation will come in due course.There are some chilling lines e.g. Just before Nuria steps on the accelerator: ""Do you believe in God?""There are some mysterious questions put to Cesar e.g. ""Who is Eli? You called out 'Eli...Eli' while you were dreaming. Is she a girl?"" No such person. What then? The mystery deepens.There is quality photography in the film.   The rain in the park. And before that the reflections of foliage flashing in the car windows with glimpses of tense faces.The make-up team too does a great job On Cesar's handsome face. What a transformation!On top of all this we get a lesson on cryonics and the possibility of immortality. What more do you want for your money?Take it from me.

263,Open Your Eyes,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1105303/,"How I wish I had seen this film before seeing Vanilla Sky. There is so much subtlety, so many interesting ideas in this that have been butchered or simply lost in translation in the Hollywood version. The ending of Vanilla Sky pretty much explains everything... Abre Los Ojos leaves most of it up to interpretation and the viewers' imagination. Upon my recent second viewing, I realized how many hints there are towards the twist in the film, and how many ideas and subjects for good discussion that are in the film. The direction in Vanilla Sky seemed fine before, but in comparison, it's really daft and unimaginative. The majority of the good stuff in VS is stolen directly from ALO. A lot of it is changed to fit Hollywood's standards(and we all know how... high... they are), and the authenticity of the great idea is almost lost through this. This is the third Alejandro Amenabar movie I've seen(the other two are Thesis and The Others), and definitely my favorite so far. Not many films can catch and keep your interest even when you've already seen a (bastardized and cheaper) version of it already. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Like Amenábar's other films, this is slow and deliberate(whereas Crowe's version, in comparison, seems somewhat rushed, trying to get to the end as fast as possible, despite being a full half hour longer), and it really works to the films benefit. The music is wonderful, and it fits perfectly in every scene. The mood and atmosphere of the film is great. The effects are excellent... by comparison, those of Vanilla Sky are overly flashy and obvious. Here, they're beautiful and very subtle, like the rest of the film. The cinematography is very good, and far superior to that of VS. I realize that this seems more like a comparison between the two films than a review, but I can't seem to find the words to express just how great this is. See it for yourself. And in the name of all that is good and just, see it before you even consider watching Vanilla Sky. I recommend this to fans of intelligent films and/or Alejandro Amenábar. This is quite probably the best film he has made so far(though I haven't seen Mar Adentro yet). 9/10",positive,"[['this film', 'Vanilla Sky'], ['much subtlety', 'translation', 'Hollywood', 'version'], ['Vanilla Sky', 'everything', 'Abre Los Ojos', 'interpretation', 'imagination'], ['recent second viewing', 'the twist', 'the film', 'good discussion', 'the film'], ['The direction', 'Vanilla Sky', 'comparison'], ['The majority', 'the good stuff', 'VS', 'ALO'], ['A lot', 'Hollywood', 'the authenticity', 'the great idea'], ['Alejandro Amenabar', 'movie', 'Thesis', 'Others'], ['interest', 'version'], [], ['Amenábar', 'deliberate', 'Crowe', 'version', 'comparison', 'the end', 'a full half', 'hour', 'benefit'], ['The music', 'every scene'], ['The mood', 'atmosphere', 'the film'], ['comparison', 'Vanilla Sky'], ['the rest', 'the film'], ['The cinematography', 'VS'], ['a comparison', 'a review'], [], ['the name', 'Vanilla Sky'], ['Alejandro Amenábar'], ['film', 'Mar Adentro'], []]","[['film', 'Vanilla Sky'], ['much subtlety', 'ideas', 'translation', 'Hollywood version'], ['Vanilla Sky', 'explains everything', 'Abre Los Ojos', 'interpretation', 'viewers', 'imagination'], ['recent second viewing', 'many hints', 'twist', 'film', 'many ideas and subjects', 'good discussion', 'film'], ['direction in Vanilla Sky', 'comparison'], ['majority', 'stuff in VS', 'ALO'], ['lot', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'authenticity', 'great idea'], ['Alejandro Amenabar movie', 'Thesis', 'Others', 'favorite'], ['many films', 'interest', 'version'], ['eyes'], ['Amenábar', 'other films', 'deliberate', 'whereas Crowe', 'version', 'comparison', 'end', 'half hour', 'films benefit'], ['music', 'scene'], ['mood and atmosphere', 'film'], ['effects', 'comparison', 'Vanilla Sky'], ['rest', 'film'], ['cinematography', 'VS'], ['comparison', 'films', 'review', 'words'], [], ['name', 'Vanilla Sky'], ['fans', 'intelligent films', 'Alejandro Amenábar'], ['film', 'Mar Adentro'], []]"
264,Gattaca,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0417499/,"Gattaca is in many ways the best film I have seen about prejudice. Just as people have been judged for centuries by the color of their skin, Gattaca predicts that in the future there will be a more subtle discrimination. It being a science fiction film helps make it more effective by allowing us to feel the emotions of the characters with little of our own history getting in the way. A haunting musical score goes well with the feeling of the film.Ethan Hawke as Vincent does a fine job showing the pain of someone whose life is limited before he even tries. But just as interesting were the supposedly superior characters; Vincent's girlfriend, brother and double who suffer from the lie that genetics can perfectly predict a person's life.The film that Gattaca most reminds me of is Blade Runner. They are both about genetic engineering gone very wrong but Gattaca takes a very different approach. The problems are more subtle in Gattaca involving our own desires for success for ourselves and through our children. Amazingly, Gattaca is a good science fiction film with a small budget, few special effects and mostly filmed in existing modern buildings.After seeing this film for a second time I liked it even better as the plot seemed more plausible.

It is prolific, stylish, thought-provoking, and one of the few recent science fiction movies that totally foregoes special effects and does it well.There is nothing about Gattaca that I didn't like.

This was a reworking of the Christmas Carol plot except in this version Scrooge isn't taught anything about goodness or love for his fellow man. He is just terrorized to the point of madness and the audience is supposed to accept this as a good thing to do. In the end he accepts that it was all for the best and even thanks the brother and offers to pay for half of the cost of the plot to terrorize him.

267,The Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1989184/,"I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.10/10",positive,"[[], [], ['the cold reception'], ['Hollywood', 'story', 'an investment', 'banker', 'Nicholas Van Orton', 'Michael Douglas', 'greedy', 'self', 'huge mansion'], ['brother', 'Sean Penn', 'a card', 'the company'], ['absolute edge', 'the seat', 'stuff', 'David', 'fincher', 'a time', 'Hollywood'], ['the midst', 'a waitress', 'Christine'], ['the movie', 'a fun roller-coaster ride', 'this movie', 'the atmosphere', 'the movie'], ['David', 'fincher', 'the dark', 'tone', 'great background', 'music'], ['The camera', 'work', 'the scene', 'father', 'death'], ['another side', 'Nicholas van', 'orton', 'the way'], ['dimensional guy', 'crisis'], ['the game', 'a character', 'study', 'the myriad', 'behaviour', 'the movie'], ['quick editing', 'the popular way', 'today', 'Game', 'atmosphere', 'the strength'], ['Deborah Kara Unger', 'a great performance', 'a character', 'grey'], ['the perfect person', 'this character', 'mysterious look'], ['Sean penn', 'a great performance', 'much screen', 'aspect', 'the movie', 'the dark humor'], ['Michael Douglas', 'a deadpan', 'delivery'], ['Game', 'a satire', 'society', 'life', 'success'], ['a crisis', 'the basic theme', 'this movie'], ['Nicholas', 'a ride', 'the truth', 'the last moment.I', 'the end', 'the credit', 'the direction', 'the music'], ['The slow motion', 'sequence', 'the end', 'all time.10/10']]","[[], ['great expectations'], ['cold reception', 'critics and audiences'], ['Hollywood thrillers', 'story', 'investment banker', 'Nicholas Van Orton', 'Michael Douglas', 'roles', 'greedy and self', 'huge mansion'], ['brother', 'Sean Penn', 'card', 'company'], ['absolute edge', 'seat stuff', 'David fincher', 'time', 'movies', 'Hollywood'], ['midst', 'waitress', 'Christine'], ['movie', 'fun roller-coaster ride', 'many twists and turns.What', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'movie'], ['David fincher', 'dark tone', 'background music'], ['camera work', 'scene', 'father', 'death'], ['scenes', 'side', 'Nicholas van orton', 'way'], ['dimensional guy', 'crisis', 'many sides'], ['game', 'character study', 'myriad changes', 'behaviour', 'movie'], ['gimmicky twists', 'quick editing', 'popular way', 'movies today', 'Game', 'atmosphere', 'strength', 'performances'], ['Deborah Kara Unger', 'great performance', 'character with shades', 'grey'], ['perfect person', 'character', 'mysterious look'], ['Sean penn', 'great performance', 'much screen', 'aspect', 'movie', 'dark humor'], ['Michael Douglas', 'certain comments', 'deadpan delivery'], ['many ways', 'Game', 'satire on society', 'people', 'things in life', 'success'], ['crisis', 'emotions in people', 'people', 'basic theme', 'movie'], ['emotions as Nicholas', 'ride', 'truth', 'last moment.I', 'tears', 'eyes', 'end', 'credit', 'direction', 'music'], ['motion sequence', 'end', 'endings', 'time.10/10']]"

269,The Fugitive,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0321769/,"Nothing is more thrilling to see than two characters with superior intelligences, pitting their wits against each other. A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. For these reasons, ""The Fugitive"" is a huge blessing for a movie critic such as I. I was just thrilled by the excitement, the performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and the whole Hitchcockian aura that this sensational film delivered. Even though we have been seeing too many films based on television series come out lately, ""The Fugitive"" is certainly not one of those that we can add to that routine bushel.Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by Lt. Gerard (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious ""one-armed man."" As I have stated, this is a simple plot that requires no superficial decoration.Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character. Jones, who has never really been considered a headliner until now, creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent. His only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin.I have not previously been a fan of the director Andrew Davis's work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked my interest. With such films as ""Under Siege,"" ""Code of Silence,"" and ""Above the Law,"" he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris). Here, he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot). With quick pacing, a never-a-dull-moment storyline, and great actors, ""The Fugitive"" ranks itself as one of the best action films of this decade, and definitely one of the best films of 1993.

272,Mississippi Burning,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1179479/,"THE FILM: The third of Parker's 80's heyday films following Birdy and Angel Heart,Mississippi Burning is an acting masterclass.From Hackman and Defoe in the leads to all the supporting cast. As per usual it looks great and has some strong images. For all this it gets 7 out 10.THE STORY: Is based on the real events of the murder of 3 civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi and the subsequent FBI investigation into their deaths. The problem is not with the ongoing story of how the Fed's crack the case.This is fiction based on fact and as a police story it works fine.THE COMPROMISE: 1, the FBI. J.Edger Hoover in 1964 was possibly the most powerful man in the country, with a file on everyone of importance or power.The FBI was his private fiefdom. Mr.Hoover believed Martin Luther King was a Communist and had no sympathy for the Civil Rights Movement.This is mentioned in one small line of script.The Bureau would have to go after murderers but was certainly on no crusade. Mr.Hoover detested the Kennedys and only kept his job because he had enough info to destroy them.So how the Defoe character, as a Kennedy man , got beyond a filing job is hard to say. Mr.Hoover used Hollywood to create the myth of the G-man ,this myth is still alive and kicking in this film.The Gene Hackman character had been a Mississippi sheriff and obviously part of a Bureau dirty tricks squad and we are expected to believe he has a bleeding heart under his badge. What would have made it interesting if his character was more truthful.The FBI was an all white agency and it certainly was not politically correct.Mr Hoover's views were no secret so rascism would certainly not effect anybody'career.Again this is hinted at in his speech about his father. 2,the KKK, It seems the whole white community in the South is a member which oversimplifies the situation a lot. Also, it does not show the main cause of the hatred was the Southern establishment,the wealthy landowners who encouraged the politicians,the police and judiciary to preach segregation as a classic measure of divide and rule of the poor- whites and African-Americans. It also ignores the fact that segregation had been twisted into the very fabric of the Southern states post- Confederacy identity. 3,the African-Americans, The docile passivity,gospel singing over ashes of churches and the lack of anger is patronising in the extreme.The Civil rights movement was born in South and the churches were its most vocal advocates.Maybe if this film had been made in the 70's rather than the 80's these major background issues would not have been ignored.",negative,"[['FILM', 'The third', 'Parker', 'Birdy', 'Angel Heart', 'Mississippi Burning', 'masterclass.From', 'Hackman', 'Defoe', 'cast'], [], ['STORY', 'the murder', 'Mississippi', 'FBI', 'investigation'], ['The problem', 'the ongoing story', 'Fed', 'crack', 'the case.This', 'fiction', 'fact', 'a police', 'story', 'COMPROMISE', 'FBI'], ['J.Edger Hoover', 'powerful man', 'the country', 'a file', 'everyone', 'importance', 'power.The', 'FBI', 'private fiefdom'], ['Mr.Hoover', 'Martin Luther King', 'Communist', 'no sympathy', 'Civil Rights Movement.This', 'small line', 'script.The', 'Bureau', 'no crusade'], ['Kennedys', 'job', 'Defoe', 'character', 'Kennedy', 'man', 'a filing', 'job'], ['Mr.Hoover', 'Hollywood', 'the myth', 'G-man', 'this myth', 'Gene Hackman', 'character', 'Mississippi', 'sheriff', 'part', 'Bureau', 'dirty', 'squad', 'a bleeding heart', 'badge'], ['character', 'FBI', 'all white agency', 'Hoover', 'rascism', 'effect', ""anybody'career.Again"", 'speech', 'father'], ['KKK', 'the whole white community', 'South', 'a member', 'the situation', 'a lot'], ['the main cause', 'the hatred', 'the Southern establishment', 'the police', 'judiciary', 'segregation', 'a classic measure', 'divide', 'rule'], ['the fact', 'segregation', 'fabric', 'Confederacy', 'identity'], ['The docile', 'passivity', 'gospel', 'singing', 'the lack', 'anger', 'the extreme.The', 'Civil', 'movement', 'South', 'this film', 'these major background']]","[['FILM', 'third of Parker', 'heyday films', 'Birdy', 'Angel Heart', 'Mississippi Burning', 'masterclass.From Hackman', 'Defoe', 'leads', 'cast'], ['strong images'], ['STORY', 'real events', 'murder', 'rights activists', 'Mississippi', 'FBI investigation', 'deaths'], ['problem', 'ongoing story', 'Fed', 'crack', 'case.This', 'fiction', 'fact', 'police story', 'fine.THE COMPROMISE', 'FBI'], ['J.Edger Hoover', 'powerful man', 'country', 'file on everyone', 'importance', 'power.The FBI', 'private fiefdom'], ['Mr.Hoover', 'Martin Luther King', 'Communist', 'sympathy', 'Civil Rights Movement.This', 'line of script.The Bureau', 'murderers', 'crusade'], ['Kennedys', 'job', 'Defoe character', 'Kennedy man', 'filing job'], ['Mr.Hoover', 'Hollywood', 'myth', 'G-man', 'myth', 'Gene Hackman character', 'Mississippi sheriff', 'part', 'Bureau dirty tricks squad', 'bleeding heart', 'badge'], ['character', 'truthful.The FBI', 'white agency', 'Hoover', 'views', 'rascism', ""effect anybody'career.Again"", 'speech', 'father'], ['KKK', 'whole white community', 'South', 'member', 'situation', 'lot'], ['main cause', 'hatred', 'Southern establishment', 'wealthy landowners', 'politicians', 'police and judiciary', 'segregation', 'measure of divide', 'rule', 'poor- whites and African-Americans'], ['fact that segregation', 'fabric', 'Southern states', 'Confederacy identity'], ['African-Americans', 'docile passivity', 'gospel singing', 'ashes of churches', 'lack of anger', 'extreme.The Civil rights movement', 'South', 'churches', 'film', 'background issues']]"
273,Mississippi Burning,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0259639/,"Well, I guess this is why movies are so personal to the viewer.I've read some of the other comments here and have seen words like ""condescending"" and ""mediocre.""I couldn't disagree more.  ""Mississippi Burning"" is an intellectually challenging movie.  It demands that you immerse yourself in the worst of southern culture, whether you like it or not.Based on a true story, the film takes place in 1964 (my birth year, incidentally) in a small town ugly and virulent with racism.  The good ol' boy sheriff and his stoolies ambush and in cold blood murder three civil rights workers.  The world's a-changing, but the power-brokers in this place refuse to let that happen.  They'll do anything to prevent blacks from taking their rightful place at the table - literally.The FBI sends a couple of mismatched agents in to search for the three missing young men.  One agent (Hackman) is 'old school', sly, and knows his enemies a little too well.  The other (Dafoe) is a naive Kennedy fire-eater, ready to bring the full force of the FBI and military down upon this small town's head.  Although he is easy to underestimate at first, he grows into his role, showing astonishing decisiveness and strength.The relationship between the town's blacks and whites is complicated and fraught with rules - spoken and unspoken.  It's a not-so-secret secret that the civil rights workers have been murdered.  Hackman and Dafoe just have to get the bodies and the evidence, that's all.  Fear and loathing prevent that from happening, until the wife of a deputy (the amazing Frances McDormand) throws herself on the fire and blows her slimy husband's alibi.There is justice - of a sort - in the end.  It's not enough.  Real change crawls on it's belly in the south.""Mississippi Burning"" is a movie of operatic gestures.  The script is spongey with regional color and snappy, powerful dialogue.Hackman and McDormand are simply magical.  They don't take or make a false step from the first frame to the last.  As she would go on to prove in later films, McDormand doesn't just 'play' a character - she IS that character. And Hackman is never more affecting that in this film.  One syllable from him is more subtle than an entire Shakespeare speech when delivered by a lesser actor.  Hackman is a national treasure.IMO, Dafoe is a well-meaning revelation until circumstances forces him to cave into Hackman's just-get-it-done ways.  He comes to see that idealism must relent to pragmatism in extreme cases, although that knowledge repulses him.  He wants nothing more than to get out of the south and go home to a world he believes is cleaner and more simple.The conclusion of ""Mississippi"" is more bitter than sweet.  The guilty are arrested and convicted, although their various punishments are a joke.  (R. Lee Ermey is the only one in the bunch who meets a just fate.)  McDormand is brutally beaten to within an inch of her life for betraying the status quo and doing the right thing.  Although she and Hackman have fallen in love, she refuses to leave with him because ""this"" - gesturing to the vandalized ruins of the house she was born in - ""is my home.""I know the history, and I know this movie inside and out.  And yet I still bawl like a baby every time I see it.

275,Predator,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4020352/,"SPOILER: Predator (1987) is a masterpiece - the greatest bad-ass best Sci-Fi action film of all time. I love this Sci-Fi action flick to death! Predator is Epic Sci-fi Action movie of the 80's, my number 1 personal favorite best action sci-fi classic film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and the rest of his team are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator, that's what makes this film and story more interesting than. This is very fast paced action flick, you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action Sci-Fi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. Is my number 1 Schwarzenegger best Action Sci-Fi Epic movie. The best action movie ever made! Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer is my comic book hero this is my hero. The hunted becomes the hunter on the end of the film when he camouflage with mud to defend him self against the Predator-ultimate hunter and hunts him down by setting booby-traps for him the best! ""If it bleeds, we can kill it."" In the remote jungle of a Central American country, an elite group of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer, embarks on a CIA mission to clear out a guerrilla stronghold and rescue the remaining hostages. However, the hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent, otherworldly being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch's team. Possessing a chameleon like camouflaging ability and a deadly alien arsenal, the creature tracks down the soldiers one by one.This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with an $98 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidia Carillo, Shane Black, Sonny Landham and Kevin Peter Hall they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.Predator is the 1980's most adrenaline-pumping, action-packed, violent mainstream film of the decade, a film replete with nearly non-stop action, loud, messy violence, huge muscles, big guns, and an extraterrestrial killing machine with infrared sight and a laser cannon on his shoulder thrown in for good measure. The film's budget was around $15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12, 1987, where it grossed $59,735,548. Initial critical reaction was mixed; criticism focused on the thin plot.Predator is a 1987 American science-fiction action directed by John McTiernan.10/10 My all time favorite action film I love it to death it is my personal favorite action film of all time. Predator is a masterpiece, one of the best Sci-Fi action films of al time. I own the DVD and I also own the Blu-ray disc.

276,Blue Velvet,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3081142/,"David Lynch is a very love-him-hate-him director, with people fascinated by his style and imagery and others who find his films not easy to follow and too weird for their tastes. As somebody who loves Lynch and a lot of his films(the only one I've disliked is Dune), Blue Velvet is up there at the top. The Elephant Man(never has there been a film that moved me more) may be my personal favourite but Blue Velvet is quite possibly Lynch's masterpiece. Loved Mulholland Drive as well, but it is not as accessible as Elephant Man or Blue Velvet- films that even those who aren't fans of Lynch are likely to love- and is his most polarising most likely.Blue Velvet is an incredible-looking film. All of Lynch's films are beautifully shot and that is true of Blue Velvet as well, and the imagery is both hauntingly surreal and beautiful, all the different colours really popping out at you. The music is hypnotic with a very haunting undercurrent and really adds to the story's strangeness and mystery elements. The script is thoughtful and cohesive with a dose of weird but subtle humour as well as some deliberately not so subtle parts(especially with villain Frank Booth). The atmosphere created is the very meaning of scintillating and suspense levels are to the maximum. The story- one of the most coherent and accessible of any Lynch film- is always interesting and entertaining, the detective story elements are genuinely suspenseful and at times scary, Lynch has never directed a tenser scene than the climax here.Lynch's direction is superb; along with Mulholland Drive it contains some of his best. The characters all serve a point to the story and they are very interestingly written, in the case of Frank Booth, one of the most evil and fascinating villains on films, iconic. The acting is superb as well, especially with Dennis Hopper who's terrifyingly sadistic and sometimes hilarious, he is very over the top but in a gleefully enjoyable way. Kyle MacLachlan has never been in a better film or given a better performance than here, he's certainly not had a character as interesting either, Laura Dern is great and sensual Isabella Rossellini has a challenging role that she plays to truly devastating effect. Look out for an oddball but memorable appearance from Dean Stockwell as well.

277,Blue Velvet,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0970732/,"In the early moments of ""Blue Velvet"" we see idealized small town images - blooming red roses and immaculate white picket fences - accompanied by the sounds of the gentle Bobby Vinton pop tune that gives the film its title. If you sense something unsettling about this perfection, that's only appropriate. ""Blue Velvet"" is a David Lynch film, you see, and it won't be long at all before a clean-cut college student comes across a rotting ear in an open field.Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is the boy who finds the ear, and Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) is the blonde policeman's daughter who assists Jeffrey when he decides to investigate the truth about his disturbing discovery. Sandy and Jeffrey link the ear to night club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and later, a deranged man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).""I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert,"" Sandy tells Jeffrey when he decides to sneak into Dorothy's apartment. As Jeffrey becomes sexually entangled with Dorothy, we can only cast similar doubt.It's true that ""Blue Velvet""'s dark mysteries have the power to repulse. Voyeurism, rape, torture, and murder are all key to the plot. Yet the film is also spellbinding in its beauty. Vibrant colors and ominous shadows offer gorgeous contrast - call it Technicolor noir - and the film is rife with unforgettable imagery. Moments big and small, from MacLachlan playing with a child's birthday hat to Dean Stockwell's show-stopping lip-synch of Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams"", are as haunting as anything you will see at the movies anywhere.The acting is top-notch. MacLachlan is just right as the lost innocent Jeffrey, and Hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint Frank. Rossellini's performance as Dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous: this is her defining moment as an actress.""Blue Velvet"" is perhaps the quintesstential David Lynch film. His strange humor and painterly gift for creating stunning images are prominently on display, and the film illustrates Lynch's contradictory impulses toward unbridled nastiness and aw-shucks sweetness like no other has.

278,The King of Comedy,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0201996/,"This is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. The first time I saw it in 1983, my dad took me to see it with my older cousin, who laughed hysterically throughout the film, then said afterwards how much he hated it. That was a memorable moment, but the film itself also made a very large impression on me.  Despite the title, it is anything but a comedy, save for some amusing moments that could pass for dark comedy.The story involves a 34 year old nerd (Robert DeNiro) who wants badly to be a standup comedian, but his only method of trying to attain this goal is by essentially stalking a popular talk show host played by Jerry Lewis.  The performances are amazing, of course DeNiro can never fail at playing someone offbeat and deranged.  Jerry Lewis is very good as the talk show host, and Sandra Bernhard is also well cast as a fellow stalker.  The film is a tough watch as its tense and uncomfortable throughout, yet entertaining and intruiging enough so it never crosses the line into unbearable, which I imagine must have been exactly what filmmaker Scorcese was going for. Overall, the film is a combination of disturbing, entertaining, and unforgettable.  What's more, it holds up extremely well seventeen years later, although it initially did not do well at the box office.

280,Halloween,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1056856/,"My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece.Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again.The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.Never the less, I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time.

281,Halloween,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0160248/,"I have just recently been through a stage where I wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday's so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don't. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett, "" I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. "" That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn't. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn't. But it's astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won't let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don't know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven's final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?And just to follow up after seeing Zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.",positive,"[['a stage', 'horror', 'a candle', 'horror'], ['this forum', 'the vileness', 'Haunting', 'Urban Legend'], ['true horror'], ['the point', 'local video', 'store', 'the classic horror'], ['Friday', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Nightmare', 'Elm Street', 'Jaws', 'Exorcist', 'Angel Heart', 'Exorcist', 'Halloween'], ['own right', 'Halloween'], ['Halloween', 'something', 'no other film', 'the history', 'horror', 'film', 'blood', 'gore', 'the living'], ['a room', 'Michael Myers'], ['No movie'], ['No movie.John', 'Carpenter', 'a low budget', 'film', 'a generation', 'movie'], ['fear', 'an audience'], ['element', 'fear'], ['that shadow'], ['that noise', 'upstairs'], ['someone', 'every element', 'textbook', 'horror'], ['today'], [], ['No one', 'detail', 'blood'], [], ['a giant special effect', 'a wall'], ['the killer', 'scare'], ['Halloween', 'no other film', 'this endeavor.In', 'Micael Myers', 'sister', 'a large butcher', 'knife', 'life', 'an institute'], ['Loomis', 'doctor', 'Sheriff Brackett'], ['the manic', 'relentless idea', 'a killer', 'nothing'], ['Laurie'], ['No one'], ['Halloween II', 'the story', 'Carpenter', 'a haunting', 'score', 'masterpiece', 'horror'], ['scene'], ['the scene', 'Annie', 'way', 'Paul'], ['the car'], ['the house'], ['the car', 'door'], ['The audience'], ['Paul'], [], ['the mist', 'Myers', 'the back seat'], ['a great scene', 'attention', 'detail'], ['Annie'], ['Carpenter', 'the hell', 'movie'], ['a killer', 'standing', 'the background', 'a wall', 'dark', 'creepy', 'haunting', 'music', 'a sinister', 'story', 'Donald Pleasance', 'a menacing', 'relentless killer'], ['advice', 'film', 'day', 'age', 'Halloween'], ['the blue print'], ['Carpenter', 'Hitchcock', 'director', 'everything'], ['the mindless horror', 'the difference', 'cuteness', 'Halloween', 'a film'], [], [], ['nothing', 'film', 'Wes Craven', 'final Nightmare'], ['Halloween'], ['a film', 'Urban Legend'], ['Legend', 'the movie'], ['Halloween', 'fear', 'seat'], ['horror', 'film', 'Zombie', 'version'], ['definition'], ['Zombie', 'version', 'the brilliance', 'this one']]","[['stage', 'horror films', 'candle', 'horror films'], ['forum', 'vileness of films', 'Haunting', 'Urban Legend'], ['others', 'true horror'], ['point', 'video store', 'horror films'], ['Friday', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Nightmare On Elm Street', 'Jaws', 'Exorcist', 'Angel Heart', 'Exorcist and Halloween'], ['other films', 'classics', 'own right', 'Halloween'], ['Halloween', 'something', 'other film', 'history of horror film', 'subtle techniques', 'techniques', 'blood and gore', 'living daylights'], ['room', 'lights', 'Michael Myers'], ['movie', 'last ten years'], ['movie.John Carpenter', 'budget film', 'generation of movie goers'], ['budgets', 'figures', 'fear', 'audience'], ['element of fear'], ['shadow'], ['noise upstairs'], ['ways', 'someone', 'element of textbook horror'], ['own ideas', 'ideas that people', 'today'], [], ['one', 'detail', 'scares', 'special effects', 'rivers of blood'], [], ['giant special effect', 'loud noises', 'wall'], ['moments', 'killer', 'scare'], ['Halloween', 'other film', 'endeavor.In', 'Micael Myers', 'sister', 'butcher knife', 'years', 'life', 'institute'], ['Loomis', 'doctor', 'Sheriff Brackett', 'years', 'eyes'], ['manic', 'relentless idea', 'killer', 'nothing'], ['Laurie'], ['one'], ['Halloween II', 'story', 'Carpenter', 'haunting score', 'techniques', 'masterpiece of horror'], ['scene'], ['scene', 'Annie', 'way', 'Paul'], ['car and tries'], ['keys', 'house'], ['car door', 'keys'], ['audience'], ['Paul'], ['windows'], ['mist', 'Myers strikes', 'back seat'], ['great scene', 'attention', 'detail'], ['Annie'], ['observations that Carpenter', 'hell out of movie goers'], ['Halloween uses', 'images', 'killer standing', 'background', 'wall', 'dark rooms', 'creepy', 'haunting music', 'sinister story', 'Donald Pleasance', 'menacing', 'relentless killer'], ['advice', 'film makers', 'day and age', 'Halloween'], ['blue print', 'scary movies'], ['Carpenter', 'Hitchcock', 'steps', 'director', 'personifies everything'], ['horror films', 'difference between evil', 'cuteness', 'Halloween', 'film'], [], [], ['nothing', 'film', 'Wes Craven', 'final Nightmare'], ['beings', 'Halloween'], ['hundred times', 'film like Urban Legend'], ['Urban Legend', 'movie'], ['Halloween', 'fear', 'seat'], ['horror film', 'Zombie', 'version'], ['definition'], ['Zombie', 'version', 'brilliance', 'one']]"
282,The Conversation,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0134704/,"Harry Caul: `I'm not afraid of death, but I am afraid of murder.'Two weeks ago I wrote a review of `The Silence of the Lambs' I said I thought that it was one of the greatest suspense films of all time. Well Francis Ford Coppola's ingenious and frightening film isn't one of the best suspense films of all time; it simply is the greatest suspense film of all time.  It follows professional ease dropper Harry Caul's job on a conversation that goes way beyond anything that he ever could expect. This film is truly something else in its own right.  Coppola is such a master, such a brilliant mind.  This film is him at his best, after `The Godfather' and before part two.  He makes this film so brilliantly and so knowing of what emotions the audience will feel, every pause and every silence is direct and timed.  The film is completely intentional.  It is constructed off of films like Michelangelo Antonioni's `Blow-up' or most Hitchcock films.  Coppola takes these aspects brought by most of the great filmmakers and takes them to a whole new level of personal texture.  He puts so much more into it.  Making him (I can't say this enough) one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and most misunderstood.  His films are like pie, they look good, they taste good, heck they even smell good, but you never really know what they are made of.  All his films are deeper then they seem, it takes a true (TRUE!) film lover to respect what influences the man has made.  Look at it like this, the greatest Hollywood film of all time, `The Godfather,' the greatest War film of all time `Apocalypse Now,' The greatest Sequel of all time `The Godfather Part II,' and the greatest Independent/Suspense film of all time `The Conversation.'  What else is there to conquer?  Science Fiction?  His next film `Megalopolis' will tackle that void.  Who cares about his slips, he has made some of the greatest films of all time.In this film his talent is at its best with an involving, brilliantly executed screenplay and flawless direction.  He makes cookies into Danish, if any other man ever made this film it would be good no doubt, but the greatest suspense film of all time?  I think not.  Harry Caul's (Hackman) character is so deep and so magnified.  He is such a character's character; this film is a pure and simple character study.  Not to mention the flawless cinematography and music.  The little jazz piano riff fits the film perfectly and the cinematography is so mechanical like a piece of surveillance equipment.  The dialogue in the first few minutes is so perfectly written it makes the viewer cringe wanting to know what it is the couple is saying so when we find out it is more of a gift.  The conversation that the film is based on is set up so well all threw out the film, the more we hear the more we think, it is repetition at its perfection.  The repetition is a true part of the film, the more the viewer hears something they ask themselves why am I hearing this again, what does it mean?  Then the conversation tears at the viewer until they fall apart, just like Harry. The viewer understands his motivations, they see his reasons.  We are set up and moved around this maze of murder and mayhem, we are Harry (J). This is just one of many brilliant aspects of the film.  It never dives down or falls off it always stays paranoid like the main character.  `The Conversation' is a haunting and well constructed masterpiece that molds great acting with brilliant storytelling.  This is what films in this day and age should try to do.  But they won't, they never will, and `The Conversation' will hold its ground as the most thoughtful and suspenseful film of all time.Mark: He'd kill us if he got the chance.",negative,"[['Harry Caul', 'death', 'murder'], ['a review', 'The Silence', 'Lambs', 'all time'], ['Well Francis Ford Coppola', 'frightening film', 'all time', 'suspense', 'film', 'all time'], ['professional ease', 'dropper', 'Harry Caul', 'job', 'a conversation', 'way', 'anything'], ['This film', 'something', 'own right'], ['Coppola', 'a master', 'a brilliant mind'], ['This film', 'Godfather', 'part'], ['this film', 'knowing', 'the audience', 'every pause', 'every silence'], ['The film'], ['Michelangelo Antonioni', 'Blow-up', 'Hitchcock'], ['Coppola', 'a whole new level', 'personal texture'], [], ['this enough', 'all time', 'misunderstood'], [], ['TRUE'], ['film', 'lover', 'the man'], ['Look', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'all time', 'Godfather', 'War', 'film', 'all time', 'Sequel', 'all time', 'Godfather Part II', 'Independent/Suspense', 'film', 'all time', 'The Conversation'], [], ['Science', 'Fiction'], ['next film', 'Megalopolis', 'that void'], ['all time.In', 'this film', 'talent', 'screenplay', 'flawless direction'], ['Danish', 'any other man', 'this film', 'no doubt', 'suspense', 'film', 'all time'], [], ['Harry Caul', 'Hackman', 'character'], ['a character', 'character', 'this film', 'a pure', 'simple character', 'study'], ['the flawless', 'cinematography', 'music'], ['The little jazz', 'piano', 'riff', 'the film', 'the cinematography', 'a piece', 'surveillance', 'equipment'], ['The dialogue', 'cringe', 'the couple', 'a gift'], ['The conversation', 'the film', 'the film', 'repetition', 'perfection'], ['The repetition', 'a true part', 'the film', 'the viewer', 'something'], ['the conversation', 'the viewer', 'Harry'], ['The viewer'], ['this maze', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'Harry', 'J'], ['the film'], ['paranoid', 'the main character'], ['Conversation', 'a haunting', 'masterpiece', 'brilliant storytelling'], ['this day', 'age'], ['Conversation', 'ground', 'suspenseful film', 'all time.Mark', 'the chance']]","[['Harry Caul', 'death', 'murder'], ['weeks', 'review', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'suspense films', 'time'], ['Well Francis Ford Coppola', 'frightening film', 'suspense films', 'time', 'suspense film', 'time'], ['ease dropper Harry Caul', 'job', 'conversation', 'way beyond anything'], ['film', 'something', 'own right'], ['Coppola', 'master', 'brilliant mind'], ['film', 'Godfather', 'part'], ['film', 'knowing', 'audience', 'pause', 'silence'], ['film'], ['films like Michelangelo Antonioni', 'Blow-up', 'Hitchcock films'], ['Coppola', 'aspects', 'great filmmakers', 'whole new level', 'personal texture'], [], ['enough', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'misunderstood'], ['films', 'pie'], ['films', 'TRUE'], ['film lover', 'man'], ['Look', 'Hollywood film', 'time', 'Godfather', 'War film', 'time', 'Sequel', 'time', 'Godfather Part II', 'Independent/Suspense film', 'time', 'Conversation'], [], ['Science Fiction'], ['next film', 'Megalopolis', 'void'], ['slips', 'films', 'time.In', 'film', 'talent', 'screenplay', 'flawless direction'], ['cookies into Danish', 'other man', 'film', 'doubt', 'suspense film', 'time'], [], ['Harry Caul', 'Hackman', 'character'], ['character', 'character', 'film', 'pure', 'character study'], ['flawless cinematography', 'music'], ['jazz piano riff', 'film', 'cinematography', 'piece of surveillance equipment'], ['dialogue', 'first few minutes', 'cringe', 'couple', 'gift'], ['conversation', 'film', 'film', 'repetition', 'perfection'], ['repetition', 'true part', 'film', 'viewer', 'something'], ['conversation tears', 'viewer', 'Harry'], ['viewer', 'motivations', 'reasons'], ['maze of murder', 'mayhem', 'Harry', 'J'], ['many brilliant aspects', 'film'], ['paranoid', 'main character'], ['Conversation', 'haunting', 'masterpiece', 'brilliant storytelling'], ['films', 'day and age'], ['Conversation', 'ground', 'suspenseful film', 'time.Mark', 'chance']]"
283,The Conversation,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1038981/,"He's supposed to be the leading authority in freelance surveillance, but from the start there are hints that while he's good, he's also careless. While his apartment is locked, his landlord leaves him a Happy Birthday present. His mistress, Amy (Teri Garr in a small role) tells him she saw him standing in the staircase for an entire hour. He invites a rival co-worker to his office (which seems to be a warehouse) with several other people and carelessly allows the man to record his own conversation by means of what looks to be an innocuous pen which wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond movie. And his liaison with a call girl he meets at that party results in her stealing the tapes of a conversation he has recorded and that has lately been the focus of his obsession.This is Harry Caul, a loner who is a little too glum to be good company and takes his work seriously. Maybe too seriously -- which eventually proves to be his downfall. The fact that his own co-worker Stan (John Cazale) leaves him to go work for a rival agency, Moran, only serves to prove Harry is really someone who is so much a loner he drives anyone away from him. He can't seem to have any form of relationship -- it's only time when Amy will also leave him as she seems somewhat frustrated by this wall of privacy he's built around himself. His entire life revolves around secrecy, and he only is able to live vicariously throughout others, even if he himself feels guilty about it and would deny it because to top it all, he has a strong religious streak, and discloses under confession that he was witness of a surveillance gone wrong and which resulted in the deaths of three people. Now this assignment has him worried: he's listened to a conversation between a man and a woman and is afraid the woman's husband may try to kill them both.But is this what he's heard, or has been misinterpreted due to the limitations and distortions of sound? Like 1966's BLOW UP, which dealt with what the human eye is capable of discerning through the mechanism of a camera and what happens when one zooms in, THE CONVERSATION deals with the manipulation of sound to make out a sentence that lies just underneath the sounds of the city. But while that elusive sentence comes through -- ""he's kill us if he had the chance"" -- what Harry fails to catch is the intonation itself, which would have radically altered his deduction and completely shifted his attention. Like the definition of the word ""caul"", Harry is unable to see (or hear) the reality, or that he's been a victim of his own occupation by the end of the film; by making himself visible to whom he thinks was in danger, he's now made himself the target of surveillance by the same agency who employed him as he receives that disturbing call at the end: ""We'll be listening to you."" Whether it be real or not, one shot implies it is: a panning shot to the right, then to the left, from an elevated angle, showing us the destruction of Harry's apartment through his own hands as he has fruitlessly tries to debug his place. It's the tell-tale pan of a surveillance camera, which he has failed to discover. Again.This is most definitely not an action-packed thriller, but one that is totally cerebral -- it forces you to pay attention, to listen, to heighten your senses and discover for yourself what Harry is trying to find even when we know he will be wrong all along. Even as he seems to teeter over madness near the end as his grisly discovery of blood pouring out of a toilet bowl at the Jack Tarr Hotel indicates, we still wonder if he's actually seeing this, or not. Like BLOW UP, this is one of those mysteries that doesn't look to get solved cleanly, but by being inconclusive, lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled, and in the process, leaves one man destroyed.",positive,"[['the leading authority', 'freelance', 'surveillance', 'the start'], ['apartment', 'landlord', 'Birthday', 'present'], ['mistress', 'Amy', 'Teri Garr', 'a small role', 'the staircase', 'an entire hour'], ['a rival co-worker', 'office', 'a warehouse', 'the man', 'own conversation', 'an innocuous pen', 'place', 'James Bond', 'movie'], ['liaison', 'a call', 'girl', 'that party', 'a conversation', 'the focus', 'obsession.This', 'Harry Caul', 'a loner', 'good company', 'work'], ['downfall'], ['The fact', 'own co-worker', 'Stan', 'John Cazale', 'work', 'a rival agency', 'Moran', 'Harry', 'someone', 'a loner', 'anyone'], ['any form', 'relationship', 'time', 'Amy', 'this wall', 'privacy'], ['entire life', 'secrecy', 'a strong religious streak', 'confession', 'witness', 'a surveillance'], ['this assignment', 'a conversation', 'a man', 'a woman', 'the woman', 'husband', 'heard', 'sound'], ['BLOW UP', 'the human eye', 'the mechanism', 'a camera', 'zooms', 'CONVERSATION', 'the manipulation', 'sound', 'a sentence', 'the city'], ['that elusive sentence', 'the chance', 'Harry', 'the intonation', 'deduction', 'attention'], ['the definition', 'the word', 'caul', 'Harry', 'hear', 'the reality', 'a victim', 'own occupation', 'the end', 'the film', 'danger', 'the target', 'surveillance', 'the same agency', 'call', 'the end'], ['shot', 'shot', 'the right', 'the left', 'an elevated angle', 'the destruction', 'Harry', 'apartment', 'place'], ['the tell-tale pan', 'a surveillance', 'camera'], ['Again.This', 'an action-packed thriller', 'attention', 'discover', 'Harry'], ['madness', 'the end', 'grisly discovery', 'blood', 'a toilet', 'bowl', 'Jack Tarr Hotel'], ['BLOW UP', 'the mind', 'the process', 'man', 'destroyed']]","[['authority in freelance surveillance', 'start', 'hints'], ['apartment', 'landlord', 'Birthday present'], ['mistress', 'Amy', 'Teri Garr', 'small role', 'staircase', 'entire hour'], ['rival co-worker', 'office', 'warehouse', 'several other people', 'man', 'conversation by means', 'innocuous pen', 'place', 'James Bond movie'], ['liaison', 'call girl', 'party results', 'tapes', 'conversation', 'focus', 'obsession.This', 'Harry Caul', 'loner', 'good company', 'work'], ['downfall'], ['fact', 'co-worker Stan', 'John Cazale', 'work', 'rival agency', 'Moran', 'Harry', 'someone', 'loner', 'anyone'], ['form of relationship', 'time', 'Amy', 'wall of privacy'], ['life revolves', 'secrecy', 'others', 'strong religious streak', 'discloses under confession', 'witness', 'surveillance', 'deaths', 'people'], ['assignment', 'conversation', 'man', 'woman', 'woman', 'husband', 'heard', 'limitations', 'distortions of sound'], ['BLOW UP', 'human eye', 'mechanism', 'camera', 'zooms', 'CONVERSATION deals', 'manipulation of sound', 'sentence', 'sounds', 'city'], ['elusive sentence', 'chance', 'Harry', 'intonation', 'deduction', 'attention'], ['definition', 'word', 'caul', 'Harry', 'hear', 'reality', 'victim', 'own occupation', 'end', 'film', 'danger', 'target of surveillance', 'same agency', 'call', 'end'], ['shot implies', 'shot', 'right', 'left', 'elevated angle', 'destruction of Harry', 'apartment', 'own hands', 'tries', 'place'], ['tell-tale pan', 'surveillance camera'], ['Again.This', 'action-packed thriller', 'attention', 'senses and discover', 'Harry'], ['madness', 'end', 'discovery of blood', 'toilet bowl', 'Jack Tarr Hotel'], ['BLOW UP', 'mysteries', 'lingers', 'mind', 'credits', 'process', 'man destroyed']]"

Camera-work is exceptionally good.The screenplay is solid. I especially liked the dialogues and how toned they were. The comic relief is very well placed and it certainly had me laughing. The performances are remarkable. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are superb. Their on screen interaction is intriguing and brilliantly executed. Patricia Collinge is outstanding as the mother and sister. Hume Cronyn is very funny.I only thought that the portrayal of the two detectives was a little odd. They were quite stupid.

285,Shadow of a Doubt,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2027195/,"Alfred Hitchcock's style as a director was a bit like a train  it ran perfectly well, but only along its own lines. He wasn't comfortable adapting his style to suit the material, but when the material suited his style he could do incredible things.Three years and five pictures into his Hollywood career, Hitch had been having some trouble finding projects he was comfortable with. He had made a couple of adventure thrillers in the vein of his late 30s British films, but the old magic wasn't there. Finally, with Shadow of a Doubt he came upon a project that was right up his street. It represents a welcome return to the domestic murder dramas that had given him his earliest successes (The Lodger, Blackmail), with a storyline ideal for Hitchcock. It is the purest example of murder in a ""normal"" setting, bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the killer, helped along with plenty of the grisly gallows humour that the Master loved.Hitch's British pictures had great charm and character, but they were often technically a little haphazard. By now though he knows exactly how to use the camera to manipulate the audience. He begins by carrying us into the story, sweeping in over the city through scenery both pretty and ugly, to home in on an average looking neighbourhood. From then on, every shot, move and edit is calculated to keep up the suspense and unfold the plot. Whereas those early films were swamped and sometimes spoiled by showy camera tricks, Hitch now uses those techniques sparingly, like playing a trump card. For example, he has Joseph Cotton look directly into the camera for a brief moment as he snatches the newspaper back from Theresa Wright. Another trick is to have the camera dolly back as a character advances, only at a faster speed than the actor is moving, which gives a very dizzying effect.Special mention should also be made of Dimitri Tiomkin's score. Tiomkin was the best composer Hitch worked with before Bernard Hermann, and one of the few who really understood how a Hitchcock film needs to be scored. His sparse string arrangements really capture that sense of spiralling terror without overpowering the scene and turning it into melodrama. He interpolates Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz at just the right level, making it noticeable but never overstated throwing in just a bar or two at an opportune moment, sometimes disguising it in a minor key.We also have a great cast lined up here. This is among Joseph Cotton's finest performances, which is unusual because Hitch was not a brilliant director of actors. I believe the reason is that, although his soft, honest features meant he usually played clean-cut good guys (as well as making him the perfect choice for the friendly uncle no-one would suspect), he was actually at his best when playing villains. That air of affected friendliness, which gives way to a deadpan monotone, is ironically far more convincing than when he attempted to play genuine niceness. Theresa Wright also does a brilliant job of handling her character's transition from childlike innocence to knowing cynicism. The icing on the cake is a couple of spot-on comic relief supporting parts from Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn.It's quite appropriate that in his cameo for Shadow of a Doubt, Hitchcock is shown holding all the cards, because here he really did have all the elements working in his favour. It marks the beginning of his golden age and lays down the blueprint for such classics as Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho. This is about as close to perfect as Hitchcock's pictures get.",positive,"[['Alfred Hitchcock', 'style', 'a director', 'a bit', 'a train', '\x96'], ['style', 'the material', 'the material', 'style', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'Hitch', 'some trouble'], ['a couple', 'adventure', 'the vein', 'the old magic'], ['Shadow', 'a Doubt', 'a project', 'street'], ['a welcome return', 'the domestic murder', 'dramas', 'earliest', 'Lodger', 'Blackmail', 'a storyline ideal', 'Hitchcock'], ['the purest example', 'murder', 'setting', 'the audience', 'the killer', 'plenty', 'the grisly', 'Master', 'loved.Hitch', 'great charm', 'character', 'a little haphazard'], ['the camera', 'the audience'], ['the story', 'the city', 'scenery', 'home', 'neighbourhood'], ['every shot', 'move', 'edit', 'the suspense', 'the plot'], ['showy', 'camera', 'Hitch', 'a trump card'], ['example', 'Joseph Cotton', 'the camera', 'a brief moment', 'the newspaper', 'Theresa Wright'], ['Another trick', 'the camera', 'a character', 'speed', 'the actor', 'dizzying effect.Special mention', 'Dimitri Tiomkin', 'score'], ['Tiomkin', 'composer', 'Hitch', 'Bernard Hermann', 'Hitchcock', 'film'], ['sparse', 'sense', 'terror', 'the scene', 'melodrama'], ['Franz Lehar', 'Merry Widow', 'waltz', 'the right level', 'a bar', 'an opportune moment', 'a minor key.We', 'a great cast'], ['Joseph Cotton', 'Hitch', 'a brilliant director'], ['the reason', 'the perfect choice', 'the friendly uncle no-one'], ['That air', 'affected friendliness', 'way', 'a deadpan', 'monotone', 'genuine niceness'], ['Theresa Wright', 'a brilliant job', 'character', 'transition', 'childlike innocence', 'cynicism'], ['The icing', 'the cake', 'a couple', 'spot-on comic relief', 'Henry Travers', 'Hume Cronyn.It', 'cameo', 'Shadow', 'Doubt', 'Hitchcock', 'favour'], ['the beginning', 'golden age', 'the blueprint', 'Rear Window', 'Vertigo', 'Psycho'], ['Hitchcock']]","[['Alfred Hitchcock', 'style', 'director', 'bit', 'train \x96', 'own lines'], ['style', 'material', 'material', 'style', 'years', 'pictures', 'Hollywood career', 'Hitch', 'trouble', 'projects'], ['couple of adventure thrillers', 'vein', 'British films', 'old magic'], ['Shadow', 'Doubt', 'project', 'street'], ['welcome return', 'murder dramas', 'earliest successes', 'Lodger', 'Blackmail', 'ideal for Hitchcock'], ['example of murder', 'setting', 'audience', 'killer', 'plenty', 'grisly', 'Master loved.Hitch', 'British pictures', 'great charm and character', 'little haphazard'], ['camera', 'audience'], ['story', 'city through scenery', 'home', 'neighbourhood'], ['shot', 'move and edit', 'suspense', 'plot'], ['early films', 'showy camera tricks', 'Hitch', 'techniques', 'trump card'], ['example', 'Joseph Cotton', 'camera', 'brief moment', 'newspaper', 'Theresa Wright'], ['trick', 'camera', 'character advances', 'speed', 'actor', 'dizzying effect.Special mention', 'Dimitri Tiomkin', 'score'], ['Tiomkin', 'composer Hitch', 'Bernard Hermann', 'Hitchcock film needs'], ['sparse', 'arrangements', 'sense', 'terror', 'scene', 'melodrama'], ['Franz Lehar', 'Merry Widow waltz', 'right level', 'bar', 'opportune moment', 'minor key.We', 'great cast'], ['Joseph Cotton', 'performances', 'Hitch', 'director of actors'], ['reason', 'features', 'clean-cut good guys', 'perfect choice', 'friendly uncle no-one', 'villains'], ['air', 'affected friendliness', 'way', 'deadpan monotone', 'genuine niceness'], ['Theresa Wright', 'brilliant job', 'character', 'transition', 'childlike innocence', 'cynicism'], ['icing', 'cake', 'couple', 'spot-on comic relief', 'parts from Henry Travers', 'Hume Cronyn.It', 'cameo for Shadow', 'Doubt', 'Hitchcock', 'cards', 'elements', 'favour'], ['beginning', 'golden age', 'blueprint', 'classics as Rear Window', 'Vertigo and Psycho'], ['Hitchcock', 'pictures']]"
286,Wind River,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3856969/,"If you weren't already aware going into Wind River of just who is the brains behind this tough, tense and distinctly masculine drama, then it won't take very long for you to guess that it is Taylor Sheridan, the so-hot-right-now scribe behind the likes of Sicario and Hell or High Water. Rounding off his trilogy based around the American frontier, Sheridan directs for the first time here, and proves to be as equally adept with bringing his work to life as he is with penning it. To dub him the new Cormac McCarthy may be slightly condescending to the talented writer, but the comparisons are certainly there to be made. This is the world of tough, lean men doing what they have to do in order to survive or get by in their increasingly dire economic surroundings, and it's certainly a setting Sheridan feels comfortable in, or at least wishes he was part of.While Sicario placed us in the terrifying, claustrophobic choke-hold of the Mexican drug cartels and Hell or High Water delivered outlaw hi-jinks with serious social and economic undertones, Wind River is a movie of quiet, simmering tension played out against the backdrop of the freezing, desolate mountains of Wyoming. Hard times have come to the titular Indian Reservation and the surrounding areas, but so little apparently occurs here that a police force of over 6 officers is trusted with covering an area the size of a large city. When a young Native American girl (Kelsey Asbille) is found barefoot and dead in the snow 5 miles from the nearest residence, the minuscule department find themselves clearly ill-equipped for the investigation. The girl died from suffocating on the blood in her lungs, brought on by the sub- zero temperature, but she has also been raped. The man who found her, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), uses his knowledge and experience as a hunter to start making connections.Renner has spent so many years in superhero costumes or starring in forgettable, little-seen box-office under-performers that it's easy to forget just how he made the jump from supporting character actor to leading man material. In movies like The Hurt Locker and The Town, he demonstrated an uncanny skill at playing introverted characters emotionally scarred by past experiences. Yes, he was an outright psychopath in Ben Affleck's thrilling The Town, but it always felt like he was masking something deeper. Lambert is living with his own trauma. He pays visits to his Native American ex-wife to see his son, but their separation was clearly brought on by tragedy. In a moving monologue to the father of the murdered girl (a marvellous Gil Birmingham), he reveals through choked-back tears that his daughter had passed years earlier. It's quite possibly the best work he's ever done; utterly convincing as the strong, silent hunter who can spot a snowmobile track from a mile away, and as a potential romantic interest for FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen).She is sent from her office in Las Vegas, and arrives completely ill-prepared for the brutal conditions of Wind River. When she quickly realises she's out of her depth, Banner leans on Lambert to help her navigate the perilous conditions and vast landscape. It's a character seen many times before - even in Sicario - and although Olsen is perfectly fine, her role seems somewhat diminutive and over-reliant on her male counterpart. It's an issue Sheridan should perhaps address in his next venture, but Wind River proves that he is more than capable of visualising his own work. He shoots the wilderness as a cold, unforgiving place, where only the toughest - humans or animals - can survive, turning them wilder and more primitive in the process. The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis also give the land a mystic ambiance, similar in many ways to their work on The Proposition. Although it does digress into Quentin Tarantino territory and the final pay-off seems over-eager to highlight good from bad, Wind River deserves some recognition come awards season, as does Sheridan as a director to watch.",negative,"[['Wind River', 'masculine drama', 'Taylor Sheridan', 'the so-hot-right-now scribe', 'Sicario', 'Hell', 'High Water'], ['trilogy', 'American', 'frontier', 'Sheridan', 'the first time', 'work', 'life'], ['Cormac McCarthy', 'the talented writer'], ['the world', 'order', 'Sheridan', 'part', 'Sicario', 'the terrifying', 'claustrophobic choke-hold', 'the Mexican drug', 'Hell', 'High Water', 'Wind River', 'a movie', 'tension', 'the backdrop', 'the freezing', 'desolate', 'Wyoming'], ['Hard', 'Reservation', 'a police', 'force', 'an area', 'the size', 'a large city'], ['a young Native American girl', 'Kelsey Asbille', 'barefoot', 'residence', 'the minuscule', 'department', 'the investigation'], ['The girl', 'the blood', 'the sub- zero', 'temperature'], ['The man', 'U.S'], ['Fish', 'Wildlife Service', 'Cory Lambert', 'Jeremy Renner', 'knowledge', 'experience', 'a hunter', 'connections.Renner', 'superhero', 'the jump', 'character', 'actor', 'man', 'material'], ['Hurt Locker', 'Town', 'an uncanny skill'], ['an outright psychopath', 'Ben Affleck', 'Town', 'something', 'deeper'], ['Lambert', 'own trauma'], ['Native American ex-wife', 'son', 'separation', 'tragedy'], ['monologue', 'the father', 'girl', 'Gil Birmingham', 'choked-back', 'daughter'], ['work', 'convincing', 'silent hunter', 'a snowmobile track', 'a mile', 'a potential romantic interest', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Jane Banner', 'Elizabeth Olsen', '.She', 'office', 'Las Vegas', 'Wind River'], ['depth', 'Banner', 'Lambert', 'navigate', 'vast landscape'], ['a character', 'Sicario', 'Olsen', 'role', 'male counterpart'], ['an issue', 'Sheridan', 'next venture', 'Wind River', 'own work'], ['the wilderness', 'a cold', 'unforgiving place', 'the process'], ['The score', 'Nick Cave', 'Warren Ellis', 'the land', 'a mystic ambiance', 'work', 'Proposition'], ['Quentin Tarantino', 'territory', 'the final pay-off', 'Wind River', 'some recognition', 'season', 'Sheridan', 'a director']]","[['Wind River', 'brains', 'masculine drama', 'Taylor Sheridan', 'so-hot-right-now scribe', 'likes of Sicario', 'Hell', 'High Water'], ['trilogy', 'American frontier', 'Sheridan', 'first time', 'work', 'life'], ['Cormac McCarthy', 'talented writer', 'comparisons'], ['world', 'lean men', 'order', 'economic surroundings', 'Sheridan feels', 'wishes', 'part of.While Sicario', 'terrifying', 'claustrophobic choke-hold', 'drug cartels', 'Hell', 'High Water', 'hi-jinks', 'economic undertones', 'Wind River', 'movie', 'tension', 'backdrop', 'freezing', 'desolate mountains', 'Wyoming'], ['Hard times', 'titular Indian Reservation', 'areas', 'police force', 'officers', 'area', 'size', 'large city'], ['young Native American girl', 'Kelsey Asbille', 'barefoot', 'miles', 'residence', 'minuscule department', 'investigation'], ['girl', 'blood', 'lungs', 'zero temperature'], ['man', 'U.S'], ['Fish', 'Wildlife Service', 'Cory Lambert', 'Jeremy Renner', 'knowledge and experience', 'hunter', 'connections.Renner', 'years in superhero costumes', 'little-seen box-office under-performers', 'jump', 'character actor', 'man material'], ['movies', 'Hurt Locker', 'Town', 'uncanny skill', 'introverted characters', 'past experiences'], ['psychopath in Ben Affleck', 'Town', 'something deeper'], ['Lambert', 'own trauma'], ['visits', 'Native American ex-wife', 'son', 'separation', 'tragedy'], ['monologue', 'father', 'girl', 'Gil Birmingham', 'choked-back tears', 'daughter', 'years'], ['work', 'convincing', 'silent hunter', 'snowmobile track', 'mile', 'interest for FBI agent Jane Banner', 'Elizabeth Olsen', '.She', 'office in Las Vegas', 'conditions of Wind River'], ['depth', 'Banner', 'Lambert', 'navigate', 'perilous conditions', 'vast landscape'], ['character', 'many times', 'Sicario', 'Olsen', 'role', 'male counterpart'], ['issue Sheridan', 'next venture', 'Wind River', 'own work'], ['wilderness', 'cold', 'unforgiving place', 'humans or animals', 'process'], ['score by Nick Cave', 'Warren Ellis', 'land', 'mystic ambiance', 'many ways', 'work', 'Proposition'], ['Quentin Tarantino territory', 'final pay-off', 'Wind River', 'recognition', 'awards season', 'Sheridan', 'director']]"
287,Wind River,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3769688/,"The screenwriter who gave us ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" has come back with ""Wind River"" which he also directed and I am now convinced more than ever that Taylor Sheridan is one of the best storytellers of our time. There's something about his thrillers that are just so cunning and sharp and profound, like a great American classic, even novelist Dennis Lehane probably couldn't come up with materials that are as skillfully played as this. And with ""Wind River"" Sheridan's personal artistry mission to do some effort to right the wrongs that the system has committed against the Native Americans, continues.The story is about a rookie FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) who teams up with a tracker/hunter (Jeremy Renner) with a tragic past in order to investigate the murder of a local girl on a remote Native American Reservation.Sheridan has tackled themes surrounding the Native Americans before but with this latest one, it's not so much that he's preaching about it but he ties it into this entire fabric of community where you sense the clash between outsiders and locals, between whites and natives, so there's a level of frustration about that arises from this murder investigation that brings up all kinds of cultural suspicions, on top of which there's also a game of jurisdictions. It's a complex yet cleverly woven thriller that starts out as a whodunit and evolves into a thirst for retribution. And the fact that it's set in a very cold harsh environment just adds to the film's chilling effect.In many ways, Elizabeth Olsen performs here like Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling where at some points you kinda know that Olsen's character may be out of her elements, but at the same time that factor actually gives her a good vantage point. Jeremy Renner plays his character like an old timer western hero who knows the ins and outs of everything, a man of few words but gets tough when needed. Their dynamic is not some kind of odd couple cop duo, this is more like each of them trying to prove themselves while bringing justice to the family of the unfortunate girl. And the way Sheridan crafts the mystery from a small radius to a much larger scheme is one that will have you hooked.

288,Get Out,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3672392/,"I finished watching Get Out over 2 hours ago, but something has been bothering me since the credits rolled. A sort of unpleasant, irritated feeling that I couldn't really put my finger on until now. My biggest complaint about this horror film is that it's not actually as scary as the real life social problems it constantly hammers the viewer over the head with. It's campy jump scares and unbelievable premise, drown out the anti-racist message it could have had. In that way, it fails both as a horror movie and constructive social commentary.Most quality horror movies take real life events and intensify them to create something terrifying but relatable. The Shining was much scarier than my trip to Colorado. The Blair Witch Project was more intense than my last hike. Psycho was slightly more unnerving than my last stay at a motel.Modern racism and the history of slavery are among the most disturbing and evil aspects of the human experience and something countless people suffer from daily. It is real and it is scary. So why add B-movie brain swaps and fortune-teller hypnosis? Why base the story on a cheesy fictional premise instead of something that actually happens? Why make all but two of the characters completely one dimensional? (Keep in mind, that Chris and his friend are the only characters in the film with both a conscience and their original brain, all others are lacking one or the other). Why does a flashing light reverse brain transplants? Why would a racist white family, lure black men to them by using their own daughter as a sex object? The answer to all these questions is lazy writing.If you want to create a jarring horror movie rife with social commentary about racism at least root it in reality. Sadly, past and present, there is no lack of inspiration. I get that this movie is a very heavy handed allusion to slavery, but of all the awful things white people have done to black people, goofy brain swapping business isn't one of them.I don't get why this movie has such overwhelmingly positive reviews. The cinematography and acting were good, but the plot was trite, compared to all the different directions they could have taken it.

289,Get Out,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3693080/,"Someone remembers the movie Skeleton Key (2005, with Kate Hudson!)!? Well, Get Out is basically the same plot, whereas in Skeleton Key the transferring of the soul or whatever is done with black magic in Skeleton Key a neurosurgical procedure gets the job done. So the plot is mostly (besides the well-done clash of black and white folks culture) a copy cat (as Skeleton Key plays in the deep South we got also a little of the element of black/white culture contrasting).If I would have to choose one of both movies for a cinematic night I would watch Skeleton Key again - the dark atmosphere is far more superior and the suspense also. Also, the end is far more delicate.Get Out has some strong points - good actors, good production and especially the strange circumstances and the growing paranoia of our hero are well done. On the other side, the movie has some weak points too - imo the (re)solution is hasty done, also there are some (important) mistakes - how our hero got the stuff into his ears, as he was bound to the chair!? And the brother didn't see the stuff in his ears - he was clearly checking if the ""sheep"" is asleep and knocked out. Also didn't our bad girl see (in darkness!) the blitz of the phone - she should know that the possession/control or whatever of the host is broken, so she would never give the gun to her ""grandfather"". Also the comedy- element is a mixed up experience - some of the subtle comedy elements I liked, tiresome for me was the black buddy stuff cliché: comedy Kitsch zillion times done before - it was (partly) funny with Eddie Murphy in the 80s and maybe you got away with it in the 90s but now...And whereas a good horror-movie mostly has a bad end for the hero (Kate Hudson loses in a certain, surprising kind of way the struggle for her life), the director didn't have the guts to make a ""good"" end - ofc our hero should be shot by a cop or ride the electrical chair. Why!? Because the mad comrades of our good evil family would ofc ""delete"" all pieces of evidence of crime there will be just one solution left - our black guy would be sentenced for mass murder, or who would believe his story, as many ""decent"" white folks would testify against him!? Btw - isn't that the point of a racist society!? ;)This p.c.-ending is imo too much of fishing for compliments or sucking up to the common mainstream agenda - and a good horror movie should everything but be p.c.In short - I was entertained and I like many aspects of the movie (especially all the actors), but in my horror collection Get Out won't make it into the top 100, maybe top 250 but even that's not for sure. The script/the story just is not good enough. Get Out: a little ""horror"" snack (the horror-elements are just a few, it's more a comedy and thriller). Not more but no less. Because all this biased overrating I rated 1, my real rate is 5.note:imo the political agenda or bias of many of the reviewers and the votings (with black actors as main characters) is ridiculous - masterpieces like Blade Runner got a rating of 8.2 or Apocalypse Now one of 8.5 and Get Out got 8.1... I've become accustomed to subtract 2 to up to 3 points (deciding if I watch or not) if a black actor is involved as the main character(s) - not because of racism but because the ratings are f***ed up and I can't trust them (like all those fake reviews and ratings in the beginning of any movie initiated by the studios) - Get Out is just another proof of this hysteria.",positive,"[['Someone', 'the movie', 'Skeleton Key', 'Kate Hudson'], ['Get Out', 'the same plot', 'Skeleton Key', 'the transferring', 'the soul', 'black magic', 'Skeleton Key', 'a neurosurgical procedure', 'the job'], ['the plot', 'the well-done clash', 'culture', 'a copy', 'cat', 'Skeleton Key', 'South', 'the element', 'black/white culture', '.If', 'a cinematic night', 'Skeleton Key', 'the dark', 'atmosphere', 'the suspense'], ['the end', 'Out', 'good production', 'paranoia', 'hero'], ['the other side', 'the movie', 're', 'solution', 'hero', 'the stuff', 'the chair'], ['the brother', 'the stuff'], ['bad girl', 'see', 'darkness'], ['the blitz', 'the phone', 'the possession/control', 'the host', 'the gun', 'grandfather'], ['the comedy- element', 'experience', 'the subtle comedy', 'tiresome', 'the black buddy', 'stuff', 'cliché', 'comedy', 'Kitsch', 'zillion', 'funny', 'Eddie Murphy', 'a good horror-movie', 'a bad end', 'the hero', 'Kate Hudson', 'surprising kind', 'way', 'the struggle', 'life', 'the director', 'end', 'hero', 'a cop', 'the electrical chair'], [], ['good evil family', 'evidence', 'crime', 'solution', 'black guy', 'mass', 'murder', 'story'], ['Btw', 'the point', 'a racist', 'society'], ['This p.c.-ending', 'the common mainstream', 'agenda', 'a good horror', 'movie', 'everything', 'the movie', 'horror', 'collection', 'Get Out'], ['The script/the story'], ['horror', 'snack', 'a comedy', 'thriller'], [], ['real rate', 'the political agenda', 'bias', 'Blade Runner', 'a rating', 'Apocalypse', 'Out'], ['a black actor', 'the main character', 's', 'racism', '* * *', 'the beginning', 'any movie', 'Out', 'another proof', 'this hysteria']]","[['Someone', 'movie Skeleton Key', 'Kate Hudson'], ['Get Out', 'same plot', 'whereas in Skeleton Key', 'transferring', 'soul', 'magic in Skeleton Key', 'neurosurgical procedure', 'job'], ['plot', 'well-done clash', 'folks culture', 'copy cat', 'Skeleton Key', 'deep South', 'element', 'black/white culture', '.If', 'movies', 'cinematic night', 'Skeleton Key', 'dark atmosphere', 'suspense'], ['end', 'delicate.Get Out', 'strong points', 'good actors', 'good production', 'strange circumstances', 'paranoia', 'hero'], ['other side', 'movie', 'weak points', 're', 'solution', 'mistakes', 'hero', 'stuff', 'ears', 'chair'], ['brother', 'stuff', 'ears'], ['girl see', 'darkness'], ['blitz', 'phone', 'possession/control', 'host', 'gun', 'grandfather'], ['comedy- element', 'experience', 'comedy elements', 'tiresome', 'buddy stuff cliché', 'comedy Kitsch zillion times', 'funny with Eddie Murphy', 'good horror-movie', 'bad end', 'hero', 'Kate Hudson', 'kind of way', 'struggle', 'life', 'director', 'guts', 'end', 'hero', 'cop', 'electrical chair'], [], ['mad comrades', 'good evil family', 'pieces of evidence', 'crime', 'solution', 'black guy', 'mass murder', 'story', 'white folks'], ['Btw', 'point', 'racist society'], ['p.c.-ending', 'compliments', 'mainstream agenda', 'horror movie', 'everything', 'many aspects', 'movie', 'actors', 'horror collection Get Out'], ['script/the story'], ['horror', 'snack', 'horror-elements', 'comedy and thriller'], [], ['real rate', 'political agenda or bias', 'reviewers', 'votings', 'black actors', 'main characters', 'masterpieces like Blade Runner', 'rating', 'Apocalypse', 'Out'], ['points', 'black actor', 'main character', 's', 'racism', 'ratings', '* * *', 'fake reviews and ratings', 'beginning', 'movie', 'studios', 'Out', 'proof', 'hysteria']]"

291,Mission: Impossible - Fallout,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4420388/,"Metacritic critics gave this movie 86/100 score(based on 59 critics). RT critics gave this movie 8.5/10 rating(it has 49 reviews). Metacritic critics gave TDK 82/100 score(based on 39 critics). RT critics gave TDK 8.3/10 rating(it has 52 reviews - not including some click baiting trash bloggers🤢🚮)Yeah, I know. I'm just a random dude 🤷‍♀️👩 who criticizes these hypocritical critics and some of you don't even care about my opinion, but really 🤔 how can they rate TDK so low and this movie so high😡How dare they❗First off, there are needless plot twists that you cannot understand. Why did Erica Sloan turn against IMF? Her reasons are just not reasonable enough. How did August Walker's men infiltrate Sloan's team? We don't know much about it. They don't tell us. Sure, it was cool but my immersion was ruined. They could've been written it more subtle. Second of all, the elevator scene. Walker shows a picture of Ethan's ex-wife(clearly he carries it all the time 🤣) to Ethan and says this and that, but the reason why Walker didn't kill Ethan is his evil friend has a plan for him after he supposedly suicided. But wait, 30 minutes after that scene, Walker shoots to kill Ethan with a machine gun. This right here is the definition of lazy writing. They just tucked a stupid reason in the movie so that they could just ignore and make a fool of the audience. Thirdly, why is Julia in this movie? Don't get me wrong, It was nice to see a familiar face, and she gave herself a pretty good closure, but here's what wouldn't have happened if she wasn't in this: They wouldn't have had to put a reason, which was a really big turn off for me, not to kill Ethan. We wouldn't have gotten an awkward wire cutting scene. We wouldn't have gotten weird dreams. And probably I wouldn't be writing these negative things. Fourthly, Solomon Lane, a pretty genius guy, pulls his enemies to their objective and fights with them face to face. That's pretty cool but why? Why did he aggro'd them? Why did he even decide to stay and choose to die? This writing could've been much much better. They could've given him more clever things to do. Fifthly, the unstoppable bomb stopped by 3 people because they ''figured it out''. Sixthly, a countdown. Suprise, surprise. I really wonder why evil people put a countdown on these things. Can't they just press the damn detonator button when the time is right? Guess what happened in the end. The good guys lost and the bad guys won. Billions are dead. That was totally unexpected and hard to guessed. 10/10 original writing right there 👌💯 But hey, let's look on the bright side, they executed that last shot perfectly. The sunset almost had me for a second. Finally, the ending. You don't leave the theater with ''holy cow!1'' or ''😮'' expressions because they've already ended the movie before the end. Sure, it has a deserved and a great dark/grim ending which every plot and dialogue constantly instigated throughout the movie but you didn't get goosebumps like you did get after the TDK ended. Or, you didn't sit like you did sit after the Infinity War endedThese are just small things that TDK, a film that critics rated lower than this movie, doesn't harbor. Overall the movie is not bad. It's just that the writing could have been much more in-depth. Or maybe it's just me. After seeing that god tier praises from the critics, I expected something better than TDK. But the dialogues weren't even that close. I guess critics don't care about these small thingsBut wait, they do care about the small things. I mean look at their rating for ''Black Panther'' That movie currently at 8.9/10 rating with 51 reviews on RT. And on Metacritic it at 88/100 score with 55 reviews. I wonder what makes that movie so special for the critics 🤔 Is it the stunts or the unpredictable plot twists? Maybe it's because of its beautiful CGI effects. Nah, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's because of its absorbing and original story. Yeah, that does make more sense. Because we don't see everyday a black man who tries to be king in a fantasy land want to rule the whole world. Yeah, that sounds about unprecedented and 8.9/10 rating worthy 👌💯 But put yourself in some of the big directors like Christopher Nolan position and think that every film that you made got more negative reviews than Black Panther. What do directors need to create to get praised by these critics nowadays? A black Harry Potter❓And the worst thing is that these hypocritical critics are overshadowing people's own judgments with their dependent opinions that polluted by politics and mindsets like ""we're not fond of pretentious directors"", ''we don't like blockbuster movies that has bad morals'', ''if you're going to make a blockbuster movie, it has to have family friendly morals and good political interests''. The quality of the film is in the second place when it's come to politics. And their opinion is essential for people who can't form an opinion, and nothing can change those people's mind other than the critics. Now let me say how does this workA blogger(Some of them are SJW who's prone to give a good review to those blockbuster films that has a good moral code and political interests about homosexual people, strong women, what's right and what's wrong, etc. They love to insert their ideas like ''We want to see more feminism in movies'', ''We want to see more movies with black leads'', ''We want to see more homosexuals in movies'' etc.) watches the movie before everyone else.
They give their reaction to the site(to the RT) before the audience.
People of US see those reactions because they told to do so.
They make their mind according to those reactions and everything starts here.
If bloggers' reactions are good, they watch the movie without any question. They don't care if it's bad or not. They already have a preconceived decision.
If the reactions are mixed, they watch the movie with questions. They already think it's not that of a good movie because that's what they're expecting.
The next big movie that critics are going to bash will probably be ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)"" But not that kind of a big bash. Small bashes like they did for ""The Dark Knight"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Usual Suspects"",""Interstellar"", ''Fight Club'', ""Se7en"",""Inception""... These films, they don't have a family friendly moral code, and they all look so pretentious with their big plot twists, prominent cast and independent directors. But these professional critics don't want to promote these kinds of films, they have to say irrelevant things about them to criticize it so that they could look ""cool"" to the audience and click bait them. But of course, at some point, they have to keep their reputation maintain too. That's why they show love for some of the classic movies like ""The Godfather"", ""12 Angry Men"", ""Pulp Fiction'', ""Seven Samurai"" When they saw a Cult classic movie alike they'll eat each other to praise that film like ''Roma'' They don't want to see depressing movies, or they talk about the importance of ''entertainment'' in a movie, but after they watch ""Schindler's List"" they forget all about the importance of entertainment. The films that made by docile or unknown directors have always been more convenient for them to praise. IF the message and the moral codes is right, they have to praise those movies that involve feminism or politics, like ''Dunkirk (2017)'', ''Wonder Woman'', ''Get Out'', ''Black Panther'', ''Moonlight''... If the message isn't right, those movies are just another trash for their dump, like ""Sucker Punch"", ""Fight Club"", ""Watchmen""... Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they didn't like them because they all looked too pretentious. Or maybe they completely misinterpreted the whole message like they misinterpreted ""Blade Runner"", ""2001"", ""The Shining"", ""Psycho"" They've always been inconsistent and always will be. Next year they're probably gonna say baseless things about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood like ""there was too much violence in it"", ''there was too much N word in it'', ""there was too much blood in it"", ""the characters were too cold"", etc. without considering movie's content. Because they don't like prominent materials. They must say something out of place to criticize it. What they do is something like declaring a horror movie ""too scary"". The only thing they have is politically overwhelmed and subjective opinions that their big names on. They won't support their opinions with reasons because it's a risky approach. If a random person say the exact same things about a movie like them, nobody would take that person seriously. We wouldn't even care. I'm not saying they shouldn't criticize the big movies, just tryna point it out that their motivation, their method of criticizing is inefficient for the audience. I mean just tell me, how can the same people rate Batman Begins 6.8/10 and Black Panther 8.9/10? Don't we all have eyes to see the difference or are we all just blinded by the politics? Some of the critics made a hobby of bashing pretentious directors who loves to put his/her signature in his/her films. But, unfortunately, some people really worship these critics and nothing can change those people's minds. In their eyes, those critics are always right, no matter what. But put yourself in those directors position and try to envision critics panning your movie for the things they don't understand and people believing them blindly. They want attention and people giving it to them. But still, who am I to judge, right? I don't have some kind of a degree like those guys have. You're probably making fun of me ''But they're critics, that's what they do you stupid.'', ""Who are you to make a comment about critics' methods"", ""An idiot on the internet DESTROYS professional critics with ASSUMPTIONS and LOGIC 😂😂"" You have every right because you're right 😂👌🔥💯",positive,"[['this movie', 'score'], ['RT', 'this movie', 'rating'], ['TDK', 'score'], ['RT', 'TDK', 'rating',

292,Kingsman: The Secret Service,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3171172/,"I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of Kingsman: The Secret Service. Watching the trailer a month ago made me interested to watch this movie since I'm a fan of spy movies especially the 007 movies. The movie is about a young teenager from London called ""Eggsy"" who is chosen by a professional agent from a super secret organisation who call themselves the ""Kingsmen"" to go through the deadliest ""job interview"" to be the next Kingsman spy.That said I must say I was not disappointed. The action is fast-paced and there's a lot of comedy.The movie is sort of like 007 meets Men in Black. The movie obviously parodies the old traditional 007 formula especially of the Roger Moore era but this is done in a good way.

293,Kingsman: The Secret Service,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3148586/,"I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down ""no-blood-no-swearing"" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as ""action"" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies.

295,Captain America: The Winter Soldier,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2985397/,"This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has ""I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues"" but he's comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he's from, he's able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It's his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don't get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I'm glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it's slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long.Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it's his job to tell everybody ""Here's they way things should be done."" We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they're going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century's gray morality is at the heart of the film.Like most men from the 1940's, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he's never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it.Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn't have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn't question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn't question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he's in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he's doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief.Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it's got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive.So, this is probably Marvel's grittiest movie and it's also their best sequel to date. There's a dash of humor but there's mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film.",positive,"[['This film', 'every way'], ['The edge', 'action', 'the genre', 'fun'], [], ['the character', 'Steve Rogers', 'the chaos'], ['this century'], [], ['The serum', 'physical', 'edge', 'a mental boost'], [], ['Time', 'day', 'day', 'amazement', 'adjustment'], ['stuff'], ['the man', 'America', 'America'], ['The passage', 'time'], ['Add', 'a full blown', 'conspiracy', 'film', 'film', 'all year', 'Rogers', 'John Wayne American'], ['The world', 'shifts', 'job', 'everybody', 'way'], ['Avengers', 'the first film', 'Commandos'], ['a lot'], ['this century', 'gray morality', 'the heart', 'the film.Like', 'Steve'], ['EX', 'the first film', 'mother', 'dying', 'TB', 'Peggy', 'Bucky', 'Black Widow', 'this film', 'someone', 'story', 'own accord'], ['Natasha'], ['Fury'], ['Sam Wilson'], ['something', 'return'], ['Every character'], ['Falcon', 'example', 'awe', 'the legend', 'Captain America'], ['Steve', 'a friend', 'a fellow soldier', 'Captain America'], ['Everyone', 'the plot', 'access', 'emotional depth'], ['conspiracy', 'depth', 'this one', 'America', 'the only superhero', 'this world', 'the reboot', 'heroic'], ['this dark existential quandary'], ['resolute', 'goodness', 'complex story', 'anybody'], ['foundation', 'role'], ['The conspiracy', 'element', 'structure', 'this story', 'Captain America', 'a corner', 'the guy'], ['the viewer', 'a great ride'], ['a lot', 'character'], ['The first act', 'a punch', 'the groundwork', 'a remarkable third act'], ['time', 'Steve'], ['good character', 'depth', 'the action', 'punch'], ['the action'], ['This movie', 'the face', 'way'], ['The action', 'a lot', 'the first film'], ['the world', 'butt', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'sequel', 'date'], ['a dash', 'humor', 'a wonderful thriller', 'conspiracy', 'adventure', 'a great great film']]","[['film', 'way'], ['edge', 'action', 'genre', 'characters', 'fun'], [], ['character', 'Steve Rogers', ""I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues"", 'chaos'], ['century'], ['people'], ['serum', 'physical edge', 'mental boost'], ['emotions'], ['Time', 'Avengers', 'day', 'day amazement', 'adjustment'], ['stuff'], ['man', 'America', 'America', 'slanted values'], ['passage of time'], ['Add', 'struggles', 'blown conspiracy film', 'results', 'film', 'year', 'Rogers', 'John Wayne American'], ['world shifts', 'job', 'everybody', 'way things'], ['Avengers', 'first film', 'Commandos'], ['powers', 'lot', 'terms of loyalties', 'certain jobs'], ['century', 'gray morality', 'heart', 'film.Like', 'men', 'Steve', 'things', 'emotions'], ['EX', 'first film', 'mother dying', 'TB', 'Peggy', 'Bucky', 'Black Widow', 'film', 'someone', 'story', 'own accord'], ['Natasha'], ['Fury learns'], ['Sam Wilson'], ['something in return'], ['character'], ['Falcon for example', 'awe', 'legend of Captain America'], ['Steve', 'friend', 'fellow soldier', 'Captain America'], ['Everyone', 'plot', 'access', 'different beats', 'tones', 'emotional depth'], ['conspiracy thrillers', 'depth', 'one', 'America', 'only superhero', 'world', 'reboot', 'heroic'], ['dark existential quandary', 'other reinventions'], ['resolute goodness', 'complex story', 'questions whether anybody'], ['foundation', 'questions', 'role'], ['conspiracy element', 'structure', 'story', 'Captain America', 'corner', 'guy'], ['viewer', 'great ride', 'belief.Marvel movies'], ['lot of character'], ['first act', 'punch', 'groundwork', 'remarkable third act'], ['time', 'issues', 'Steve'], ['character depth', 'action', 'punch'], ['action'], ['movie', 'face', 'way'], ['action', 'lot', 'first film'], ['world', 'kicks butt', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'sequel', 'date'], ['dash of humor', 'wonderful thriller', 'conspiracy and adventure', 'great great film']]"
296,Gravity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2883560/,"The big ""spoiler"" is that this is a big budget Hollywood move with a preposterous plot and lots of special effects. The problem here is that nobody could possible survive through any of this, and the special effects become a substitute for any meaningful plot. Even taken on its own terms, the movie makes no sense. Sandra Bullock has become an astronaut but lacks even the basic skills for that occupation. She tells us she always crash landed the flight simulator, and we find her thumbing through an instruction manual about the size of the instructions for a DVD player to figure out how to safely pilot a space craft back to earth. She even picks the buttons eeny, meany, miney, mo style. Add to this the contrived scenario that she has not only lost a child but also is ""revived"" and given a reason to live by the now dead George Clooney appearing in a dream sequence. And how great a movie can it really be where there is only one character (and almost no dialog) on camera for most of the film. The special effects are impressive, but what they've obviously done is use computer graphics to create all the weightless effects. As such, things remain weightless even when they shouldn't be, and you eventually become more interested in looking for the screw-ups than watching the movie. Please, please, please.

297,Gravity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2932998/,"This is yet another movie demonstrating space for many new viewers, IN THE WRONG WAY.

Any of you that have studied physics and understand the concept of a vacuum, please stand up.Spoilers ahead!~~This genre is very hard to get followers as it is, but why oh why would you cast two of the worst possible people that could portray astronauts and then proceed to have them read lines that are most likely written by some guy that has absolutely no knowledge of internal conflict. Okay so here we go. -Does anyone truly believe that, during a SCHEDULED maintenance mission to a prestigious satellite like the Hubble, Russia would have been operating in the same level of orbit? OR if that doesn't hit it home, detonations are not executed in geosynchronous orbit EVER for fear of permanent debris OR how about did the engineers of either Russia or America randomly think that,"" hmm so we are going to blow up something in orbit(to reiterate this does not happen) and there absolutely won't be a chain reaction that causes the I.S.S. or the future C.S.S. to receive damage"" NO because this just won't happen ever. -Why would NASA, assuming this is our time line (she mentions Huston, which is mission control) have authorized this woman(Bullock) for space operations if she is so prone to be mentally disabled in a crisis?(loss of child, apparently no significant other or family, seems depressed so the psych. eval. would have failed) -Why if after being approved for a mission to orbit(which requires ridiculous amounts of training), would this certified astronaut and specialist(most likely an electrical engineer, which happens to be my profession), be so idiotic in a situation as grievous as this. I mean there are well over a dozen times that she seems to have the capabilities of a high school dropout. -I know this is a movie but damn, the cliché's are killing me softly.

There is a big reason why media like Star Trek has staying power, and why many of the viewers and readers can obtain a lasting memory by stopping by NASA's website and read testimonials of astronauts and see pictures from satellites etc. This movie is just a hyped up 1.5 hours of cg with a terrible script and bad acting, that has nothing to give to the space genre.

Now most movies have one or two mistakes and you just over look it but when it happens in every scene of the movie, you can't just wave it to one side.For example, when Bond leaves the London underground and starts running to save M. Here we have TWO errors. Firstly, M does not do MP's committee meetings and secondly, why does Bond run half way across London to get to her? Why not stop one of the police officer's to either drive him or to give him the car? There are so many errors, like I already said in EVERY single scene of the movie.Few others that I still remember are such as the opening scene, why does Eve who just mistakenly shot Bond with an automatic rifle not then open fire on the bad guy? How did Bond even survive such a drop? How did he end up in the arms of a beautiful woman on a beach? How did Eve even miss shooting him jumping on the train earlier? Why did the bad guy who had an automatic pistol and had Bond pinned down behind a wooden market stall decide to jump on a motorbike rather than to kill him? Why did the police bikers even drive straight towards a man firing a weapon? How did Eve even turn up with a vehicle just as Bond left the building? So many errors and so many gaps and that's just the first 8 minutes! I can go on and on and on. EVERY scene had massive errors, Even the Aston Martin DB5 scene, how comes Bond has it? Why would he even run away with M and get her killed? Are the SAS on strike? How did Bond leave the casino in Macau after killing 3 bodyguards? Does a large casino only have 3 security guards? Why even would they fight? Surely they would have just shot him as soon as he enters the casino? Javier Bardem's baddie character was ridiculous and comical. It was totally unbelievable, even an 8 year old wouldn't believe the storyline. Poor acting and the camp/gay innuendos were painful to watch.

300,Argo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2736782/,"Argo is not a particularly great film but tells an interesting story in a somewhat ironic fashion. Ironic because the central tenet of the tale is an imaginary movie and how Hollywood could create a lie to mask the rescue told in a way that is in itself as big a fantasy as the movie for that very rescue.I am a big fan of Ben Affleck and enjoy his films and think he is a capable director. But sadly Argo is pretty dull and even the fake scenes made up to ratchet up any tension fall flat.The acting is not particularly that good either. Not because the actors were at fault. Clea DuVall is a fine actress and Arkin and Goodman both excellent. But sadly the script does not give them a lot to work with. The fake scenes in the Canadian Ambassadors house are hardly riveting. Although we do get a bit of Led Zeppelin IV which showed they had some musical taste.Afflecks character is pretty two dimensional with a bit of a sad family background thrown in to make us sympathetic. Sadly it does not work. The CIA look a bit more organised than Zero Dark Thirty but we do get the odd banging and shouting scenes at the climactic fake finale scene as they rush desperately to make the flight out of Iran.That whole segment of the film was quite the worst part of the whole exercise and the shots of the Revolutionary Guard chasing the plane was frankly silly more than tense. Of course in reality they just turned up early in the morning and were waved with no fuss onto their escape flight and the movie cover was barely an aspect of the getaway.Another aspect of the movie was how it makes a point that the British and New Zealand embassies turned away folks from the American embassy which was NOT remotely the case and both embassies played a part in keeping them safe. I understand that for the narrative and pace of the movie these facts were not addressed. But I don't understand why Affleck felt the need to lie about what these people did by saying they did NOT help. Why not just say nothing at all. I guess it is a sop to the uninformed American audience who like to think that their allies are so unreliable and it makes the American part in the rescue more important. The Iranian's or Eyeranians as they have become known don't get much of a good deal either reduced to screaming lunatics rampaging around the streets hanging people from mobile cranes. But let's not forget how they ended up like this due to decades of Western interference. I am sure the vast majority of people there are decent enough folks. But America needs its boogie men and after all to be fair the hostage taking and probably rather frightening captivity of the other 50 odd Americans was not a fantasy. Overall the lies and fantasy of Argo overwhelm the good parts of the tale and drag it into the realms of the nick of time Bourne type thriller without the car chases, shoot outs or cool martial arts fights.Along with Zero dark Thirty and Lincoln another revisionist pap fest wrapped in red white and blue.

301,Argo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2752727/,"Where to even begin? Maybe with the positives?Well, I found the pacing to be pretty good, and this film wasn't an overlong snooze-fest like Lincoln, so that made it somewhat entertaining. Some of the camera work was very good--I really liked some of the shots they took. Bryan Cranston was amazing in his role--it made me want his character to be the lead actually. Alan Arkin also shone in his role. Finally, the editing was good and is rightfully nominated for an Oscar.SPOILERS!All of the other Oscar nominations are pure folly. Best Picture? Absolutely not. Really? A more boring Oceans 11 meets the streets of Tehran is good enough for Best Picture these days? How sad is that? Best Screenplay? So, turning an interesting, real-life caper into a droll, boring, formulaic Hollywood movie is a good thing? The dialogue was generally trash when Goodman and Arkin weren't delivering one-liners. At no point did any character say anything about themselves or their situation that felt like it actually mattered or had any impact. Best Sound? Seriously? In a movie that has a soundtrack populated with Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and Scottish bagpipes? Sure, real original....You can go to any college bar in America and hear that soundtrack. Did America's movie establishment collectively snort a few lines of PCP-laced coke before watching this? Is that how it came to be such a great experience?As for the picture itself, aside from the nominations, this played quite fast and loose with actual historical facts, which is kind of a no-no when doing a film based on reality. To divide the credit 95:5 USA:Canada is about a 50-point swing from where it probably should be, and Canadian reviewers have said as much. Also, the fact that Iranians are writing in that they feel the need to say they are not from Attila and the Hun and they aren't all bloodthirsty psychos bent on pillaging and murdering is pretty telling. Hollywood hasn't produced a film so stereotypically wrong about a whole race of people for, what, 3 months? I mean, Persian culture developed mathematics for crying out loud! Yet, this group of people has no more human qualities now than territorial apes? The fact that this was set in Tehran, which makes Iranians kind of important to the story and not a SINGLE Iranian is portrayed with any shred of a conscience is deeply troubling. The pigeonholing of Iranians as barbarians and Canadians like a little, ineffectual brother is absurd.I was struggling with the fact that the movie would have been so much better had Ben Affleck's character actually been played by Chuck Norris! That says something (and not that I'm a fan of Walker, Texas Ranger which I'm not). The worst part, aside from 35 minutes of Affleck-face screen time, was the meeting he went to and completely shredded everyone's ideas (which were stupid, but...no one had any other ideas, seriously? In an intelligence agency?). He subsequently proposed something so preposterous that no intelligence agency would EVER have green-lighted it, except for that it actually happened...hmmm...HOW? Maybe some more background about how this proposal made it through! Surely, that's not still classified at this point. This is how you immerse your audience in the story, Ben, you need to be stronger with the details--and give history buffs a reason to say, ""hmmm, that's something I didn't know!""TL;DR: As for my rating being 2/10, which may seem overly harsh, well, an OK movie, technically, was ruined by historical pandering, a suspense-less caper that was oh so predictable, and a series of implausible action scenes with virtually no action in them.

302,Paprika,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1680192/,"What happens when you see a wonderful film, a truly wonderful one, and you are disappointed because the very last one you saw was from the same filmmaker and was very much better? I should have watched some trash first.The better film I'm alluding to is ""Millennium Actress,"" a wonderful slippery glide through a shifting of life, movies and personal memory. Several things made that great: the drawings were in some places marvelous; the reason for the slips was never explained; and the ""wrapping"" story was incredibly thin, just barely enough. It was clearly a movie about movies and how life and film make each other.This one conflates life, dreams and movies in much the same way, and goes further by merging individual lives and dreams. But it is burdened by two things. The first is that the wrapping story is large, heavy. The second is that we have a tedious explanation about why the slips occur: some invented device. And it adopts the Godzilla/Transformers model where two giants fight, towering over the city. Jees.Two things are superior, however. One is that the dreamworlds give the artist freedom to depart from the constraints of the real. It isn't surreal: that's a very specific thing. But you do have dancing refrigerators leading a parade to hell. You may not appreciate the visuals here, in fact I suspect most won't think them special. But I did.But the main thing is the title character, a lovely redheaded virtual soul who lives in the dreamworld. She's the pinnacle of girl fantasy: capable, not real, fairy-like but strong, desirable but forceful, following the rules of the world sometimes and writing the rules at other. She's woven from something deep in the psyche, our usually unfound soulmate who writes our dreams that spill into our lives.But her appearance and character isn't what amazes here. Its how many different ways the filmmaker has her interact with the dream world. I stopped noting them because they were so varied and clever. She flies of course, she morphs. She shares a body in the real world of a woman scientist. (There's a truly remarkable dream scene when a vagina is ""unzipped"" to the forehead to reveal the true woman within.) She merges with shadows, reflections, light and shadow. She appears from dolls and billboards, clouds. From cracks and folds. Its as if there was a list of all possibilities that is being exhausted.

An hour and a half later, this is one of the best films I've seen in 2007.The plot, as best as I can describe it, concerns a group of scientists developing a device which allows one to interject your subconscious into and record another person's dreams. However, a thief is using the technology to terrorize and control others. As the scientists try to find their stolen property, reality begins to take on a different meaning...Satoshi Kon is filmmaker I've never heard of before, but what he has created is truly visionary. Paprika continually amazes with imagery which transcends conscious understanding and coherence for what can only make sense on a subliminal level. Examples include a marching band of inanimate objects, dolls and animals, a giant aquatic leviathan with a man's face and humanoid toys that act as vessels for their dreamers bodies.But what makes the film necessary viewing is not the visuals alone, it's the core of the story and varied themes that it poses. The subject matter deals with issues both contemporary and probable. The actual identities of ourselves are wrapped in an enigma. How science has its positive and negative aspects.

305,Changeling,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1969325/,"There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera, with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing, hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making: a good screenplay, a good story, good acting. For the past 10 years, many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances, unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however, given us the whole package time after time, with movies as varied as ""Mystic River"", ""Letters"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and now ""Changeling"". True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances.Eastwood has paved the way to acting honors for Penn, Freeman, Swank, Hackman, and others that were continuously ignored by the Academy. There is no denying the power of their performances in Eastwood's movies, and that leads to the center of this film: Jolie. I read recently that her performance has been attacked as being affected and the attempt of a star to look normal. Putting aside those silly and biased remarks, let's state something clearly, the lady has given us a fantastic tour de force, proving that she can be both a star when looking at the other cameras, but that when she is working for a director, she gives her best, regardless of what our perception of her private life might be. If you are a critic with a personal disapproval of that persona, keep it to yourself, concentrate on the film and the work of the performer.As the mother who desperately wants the truth about her child, Angelina is flawless. We can read the pain in her eyes, the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results, but one thing is clear, there is a drive that won't quit, and it's admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child, and it's quite inconvenient for the people who have other interests at hand.Her battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions, and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are some horrific moments in the film, as we relieve some of the injustices and Gothic horror of places like the hospital in this film. There are also some background scene that might or not reveal what really happen. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers, but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions.The film contains amazing production values, as we are taken back to an era that doesn't exist anymore.

306,Ex Machina,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3243822/,"In Blade Runner, human beings create artificial human beings – ""replicants"" – for specific purposes, and then feel entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the replicants are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female replicant, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death. In Ex Machina, a human being, Nathan, creates artificial human beings, specifically artificially intelligent female robots, for his own purposes, and then feels entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the robots are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female robot, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death.Perhaps it's just an accident of what I've read, but surprisingly few of the gushing reviews I've read of Ex Machina take notice of the fact that so much of its plot is borrowed from one of the best science fiction movies ever made. Of course there are plot differences. Most notably, Ex Machina raises more explicit issues about gender, although reviewers differ whether it is the movie that is sexist or only the character that produces the female robots or both. In any case, it appears that part of Nathan's mission is to produce a perfect female companion, which to him means one that serves you and has sex with you and is incapable of answering back. There is a trace of this theme in Blade Runner, in the character of Pris, a replicant whose job is to serve as a prostitute, but it is much fainter.Even more notable, however, are the differences in what the two films do with the material. Both movies raise basic philosophical issues about whether biological human beings are different from replicants/robots in any morally important ways. Both raise issues about what it means to be a material and therefore a mortal being. But Blade Runner reflects on these issues in intelligent and moving ways. Rachael's anguish at discovering that her precious childhood memories are not really her own, for instance, raises exactly the sort of question that philosophers of person identity like to think about: Suppose that you are about to lose your memory through an illness. The doctors, however, are able to scan your brain now, and using that scan to copy your memories back into your brain when you recover. Would those memories really be any more your own than Rachael's? The replicants also discuss their attitudes towards death. By contrast, all we know about the robot in Ex Machina is that she plots to use the hero to help her escape her death, which is exactly what she was programmed to do. More generally, in Ex Machina, the philosophical themes are only brushed on lightly as a way of trying to pass off as a serious film what is essentially an adolescent boy's fantasy - lots of special effects, naked nubile females, and guys drinking beer. And an adolescent boy's nightmare: being tricked by female characters who are essentially manipulative, think of nothing but sex and how to use it to get their own ends, and with whom one therefore can never form a genuine bond.Skip Ex Machina.

308,The Last King of Scotland,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1601064/,"The newly qualified Dr Nicholas Garrigan travels to Uganda to take up a post with a village mission. He arrives just after a coup puts Idi Amin in power of the country. During a visit by Amim to the village, Garrigan captures the President's attention by tending to a small injury to his hand and showing himself decisive and strong-willed. It is not long before the young Garrigan finds himself appointed as physician to the President and ensconced as one of his ""closest advisors"". However the initial charm shown by Amin gives way to a darker violent streak as Garrigan finds the superficial stability of the country and its leader is nothing of the sort.Famous now for the performance that will deservedly win an Oscar in a few weeks time, this film actually doesn't have Amin as the ""main"" character despite him being the draw and the title character. Instead we actually spend a lot of time with Garrigan, his experiences and his problems. Of course I understand why this was the way because Garrigan is out narrative device  a composite character who acts as our way into the inner circle of Amin and allows the audience to experience him as outsiders as well. This works well in doing this but it does also introduce problems, or at least one problem. This is the fact that, as the story goes on, we find ourselves more and more focused on Garrigan (who doesn't actually exist) rather than Amin or Uganda (who did and does exist respectively). I found this a bit irritating as it got worse because I had come to the film for Amin  as, I suspect, many will have done.Even with this though the film still works well and makes for an engaging piece. Macdonald's direction is good and his moving camera does give it the air of a documentary while still very much being a drama. Of course the thing that makes the film work is the central performance from Whitaker. The character of Amin allows him to play to his strengths and he delivers a convincingly unhinged turn, constantly menacing but also managing to have a child-like sense of fun at times and a terrifying tendency towards ruthlessness and violence. I have said before, he was brilliant in The Shield (making the whole season his own) and he is equally brilliant here. Alongside this it is no surprise that McAvoy is a bit weak by comparison. His character is not so convincing (a side effect of being a composite) and some of the narrative turns ask a lot of him  he is still good and it is not his fault that he is in Whitaker's shadow. Washington has a small role but was pretty good in it even if her presence made me wonder why they felt they had to cast an American actress, likewise Anderson but I assume that they helped get funding so fair enough. McBurney is a bit too slimy and sinister and I wasn't sure what the film was trying to say. Audiences may also recognise Oyelowo from his recent high-profile roles in HBO's Five Days and BBC's controversial Shoot The Messenger.Overall then not a perfect film but a pretty good one. The use of Garrigan is good at getting us into the story but it is a weakness that we stick with him as the focus.

309,The Last King of Scotland,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1498010/,"""The Last King of Scotland"" is a slickly made powder keg of a film about Idi Amin's (Forest Whitaker) horrific dictatorship over Uganda in the 1970's as seen through the eyes of his fictionalized Scottish doctor (James McAvoy). Whitaker is mesmerizing from the word ""go"" and brilliantly displays how captivating a character Amin was: charming, theatrical, paranoid, and mad as hell.Director Kevin MacDonald only alludes to the horrors (300,000 massacred) while delivering a music-video style account of the free-wheeling decadence of Amin's regime while he still played in favor to his people. Much of the film runs like the early parts of P.T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" or any gangster saga from Scrorsese: hyper-edited, smoothly shot scenes depicting humor, violence, sex, nudity, and overly-indulged individuals new to money and power. It would've been more compelling had tighter focus been paid to Amin instead of the highly unlikable doctor character, who for the most part comes across as a flighty, over-educated twit with foggy ideas on good deeds and uncontrollable hormones that lead him to hounding after every marginally attractive married woman he comes across, including a barely recognizable Gillian Anderson donning a British accent, and Kerry Washington as Amin's third wife (duh, doc!). About two-thirds of the way through, MacDonald lets Whitaker loose, and his rampage is awe-inspiring. It culminates in a pulse-pounding white-knuckle twenty minutes that muddle a historical event concerning Israeli hostages with the shockingly brutal finale of the young Scott's stay in Uganda. Again, it would've been more emotionally involving had the doctor been more deserving of our sympathy. Still, Whitaker is fuming and unforgettable. He totally embodies the spirit of the oft-discussed and debated mad dictator, so much so that when the closing credits roll and we see stock footage of the real Amin, you'd swear these were images of Idi Amin playing Forest Whitaker.",positive,"[['King', 'Scotland', 'powder', 'keg', 'a film', 'Idi Amin', 'Forest Whitaker', 'horrific', 'dictatorship', 'Uganda', 'fictionalized Scottish doctor', 'James McAvoy'], ['Whitaker', 'the word', 'a character', 'Amin', 'charming', 'mad', 'hell.Director', 'Kevin MacDonald', 'a music-video style', 'account', 'the free-wheeling decadence', 'Amin', 'regime', 'favor'], ['the film', 'P.T'], ['Anderson', 'Boogie', 'any gangster saga', 'humor', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity', 'money', 'power'], ['tighter focus', 'Amin', 'unlikable doctor', 'character', 'part', 'a flighty', 'over-educated twit', 'attractive married woman', 'Gillian Anderson', 'a British accent', 'Kerry Washington', 'Amin', 'third wife', 'duh', 'doc'], ['the way', 'MacDonald', 'Whitaker', 'rampage'], ['a pulse-pounding white-knuckle twenty', 'a historical event', 'Israeli', 'brutal finale', 'Scott', 'stay', 'Uganda'], ['the doctor', 'deserving', 'sympathy'], ['Whitaker'], ['the spirit', 'debated mad', 'dictator', 'the closing', 'roll', 'stock', 'footage', 'Amin', 'Idi Amin', 'Forest Whitaker']]","[['King of Scotland', 'powder keg', 'film about Idi Amin', 'Forest Whitaker', 'horrific dictatorship', 'Uganda', 'eyes', 'fictionalized Scottish doctor', 'James McAvoy'], ['Whitaker', 'word', 'character Amin', 'charming', 'mad as hell.Director Kevin MacDonald', 'horrors', 'style account', 'decadence of Amin', 'regime', 'favor', 'people'], ['film', 'parts of P.T'], ['Anderson', 'Boogie Nights', 'gangster saga', 'shot scenes', 'humor', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity', 'overly-indulged individuals', 'money and power'], ['tighter focus', 'Amin', 'doctor character', 'part', 'flighty', 'over-educated twit', 'foggy ideas', 'good deeds', 'uncontrollable hormones', 'attractive married woman', 'Gillian Anderson', 'British accent', 'Kerry Washington', 'Amin', 'third wife', 'duh', 'doc'], ['two-thirds', 'way', 'MacDonald', 'Whitaker', 'rampage'], ['twenty minutes', 'historical event', 'Israeli hostages', 'brutal finale', 'young Scott', 'stay in Uganda'], ['doctor', 'deserving', 'sympathy'], ['Whitaker'], ['spirit', 'mad dictator', 'closing credits roll', 'stock footage', 'real Amin', 'images of Idi Amin', 'Forest Whitaker']]"

The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along, you think it's someone, then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.The film is beautifully shot (on VIPER digital cameras) and once again, Fincher shows us his wonderfully adept skills with CGI shots. All of the actors shine and truly become their characters. Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. put in excellent performances, as does Mark Ruffalo. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Phillip Baker Hall join the ensemble.The only complaint I have heard that holds any water is that the film is too long.

315,Black Book,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1507195/,"Who said that they don't make films like they used to? A couple of weeks ago, I declared that ""The Departed"" was the best film of 2006. Last week, I replaced the Scorsese epic with Sofia Coppola's luscious biopic of ""Marie Antoinette"". I never would have guessed that Paul Verhoeven (Yes, the Paul Verhoeven who directed ""Total Recall"", ""Basic Instinct"" & ""Showgirls""!!!) would challenge them both with a gripping, edge-of-your-seat World War II yarn.I use the old-fashioned term, yarn, because ""Black Book"" is very much a film that feels like it was made decades ago. The lush visuals, orchestral music, European styling, wartime romanticism and cliffhanging chapters all add a certain 1950's charm to the white-knuckle plot. One gets the feeling that the ghosts of Gregory Peck, Hedy Lamarr, Ava Gardner, Spencer Tracy & Jean Harlow are embodying the cast of this classic espionage drama.The film begins in 1956 with Rachel Steinn, a school teacher at an Israeli kibbutz, being accidentally found by an old acquaintance, who is on vacation with her husband. The meeting brings back painful wartime memories and Rachel heads to a quiet place by the river to recollect our central story.So back we travel, to occupied Holland, circa 1944, and we see a more youthful Rachel, diligently practicing a bible passage in order to earn a meal from the family who is hiding her from the Germans. She, like many Jews at that time, were surviving by any means necessary in order to outlast the Nazi tyranny. However, one day, while flirting with a young man sailing on the nearby lake, her safe zone is destroyed in one fell swoop by a low flying bomber. Rachel is immediately on the run, aided by her new sailor friend.So much of this film relies on surprises and shocking twists that it would be unfair of me to detail too many plot threads. And my goodness, there are a tons of them. This is truly a definitive epic, in every cinematic sense of the word. Rachel is crossed and doubled-crossed and triple-crossed, eventually winding up as a member of the famed Resistance. Via cunning and fortunate circumstance, she manages to transform herself into Ellis de Vries, a blond bombshell who infiltrates the German command in the area. She uses a quick wit, a gorgeous voice, some feminine charms and a collection of Queen Wilhelmina stamps to crawl her way into the arms of Herr Müntze (Sebastian Koch).From deep within the Nazi camp, she is able to strategically plant a microphone and to use tidbits of acquired knowledge in order to provide the Resistance with vital information and plans. While evolving into a brave spy, she must learn how to reconcile her own personal vendettas and her surprising romantic feelings for Müntze.There are no more exciting themes for me in movies than tragic romance, espionage and escape. I have loved them all with a passion ever since I was a small child. Throw in a magnificent screenplay, marvelous cinematography, a plot that churns along with the efficiency of a Swiss watch, and the added bonus of a gorgeous actress -- the result is sure to be a huge winner for me. ""Black Book"" satisfies everything that I truly want from a film. It is the reason I go to the movies. I was utterly swept away by the intrigue, drama, romance and tragedy. This emotionally weighty film even manages to deliver a few wonderfully witty moments to break the supreme tension of it all.The cast is immense. Every one of them exudes authenticity. It is one of the best ensembles of the year. However, I struggle to call it an ensemble because it would be ignoring one of the singular performances in recent memory. Carice Van Houten is not a household name to most. She is a Dutch beauty who, if this role is anything to go by, is on the verge of a magnificent career. Her grasp on the emotional turmoil of Rachel/Ellis is of profound proportions. It is a stunning turn that flatly demands award consideration. The range on display in this movie is astonishing. Rarely have I ever been as moved by a character's heroism and charm and guile and wits. She is able to create a sympathetic creature... one that we will root for until the end... one that we trust and believe in.I cannot leave this review without admitting to my utter admiration for Paul Verhoeven, a director whose films I have often enjoyed and panned in equal measures. This is the work of his lifetime. It is the film he should list above all others on his résumé. This is a thoughtful, poignant and tremendously thrilling adventure. For attentive viewers, the final scenes of the film act as a provocative meditation on the relationships between war and justice, peace and insularity, the actions of the past and the promises of the future.

319,The Machinist,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0966041/,"""The Machinist"" demonstrates that ""Session 9"" wasn't the only creepy thriller that Brad Anderson could do. While M. Night Shyamalan and commercial fare like ""The Grudge"" get the attention and the big bucks, Anderson is quietly mastering disturbing, psychologically scary shockers. While the previous movie took advantage of our imaginations leaping around a spooky environment, ""The Machinist"" makes our discomfort palpably visual in Christian Bale's painful to look at body, as his character is ravaged by insomnia and loss of appetite; by the end of the movie it's shocking to see his normally handsome face. But all the focus on his astounding weight loss takes away from the other elements in the almost black and white film that make it a scare fest. The movie establishes ""The Twilight Zone"" mood immediately with the soundtrack, which includes generous use of the theremin, as Hitchcock did in ""Psycho."" The production design is excellent at supporting the mood.The suspense builds and is sustained through to the satisfying conclusion as you genuinely get involved in Bale's efforts to solve the increasingly mysterious happenings around him. Even though you are pretty sure he could be hallucinating, you are intrigued to figure out the trigger. Despite looking like a caricature of a Holocaust victim, Bale creates a full character, from the jocular male camaraderie of the factory where he doesn't quite seem to fit in to responding one beat off to the warmth of the two women in his life, a waitress and a prostitute with the an open heart of gold (played, as usual by Jennifer Jason Leigh, but effectively languid).",positive,"[['Machinist', 'Session', 'the only creepy', 'thriller', 'Brad Anderson'], ['M.

That reality is sort of similar to the life she already knows yet deeply unsettling in a number of ways. Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) begins a journey of adventure and self discovery when her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) relocate the family to Oregon from Michigan. No one in this new space has time for her so she spends her time exploring her new neighborhood with an talkative local boy named Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.). After discovering the odd neighbors all of whom are true characters, she is still bored somehow.All of this immense undertaking is courtesy writer and director Henry Selick, director of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the well crafted adaptation of Neil Gaiman's international best-selling children's novel. To Selick's credit this is the first 3D stop motion ever made; stereoscopic 3D. Selick himself worked on the film for three years. The style is stunning and the story is an unwavering fairy-tale nightmare that has some genuinely scary moments. is a masterful movie and an exciting tale of mystery and imagination.In the rotting nooks and crannies of Coraline's new home the real story begins and where she discovers a hidden doorway behind the wallpaper. Inside is her alternate space where there are doubles of her distracted parents now lavish loving attention on Coraline, the oddball neighbors are friendlier, and her pesky friend long longer speaks. Only her parents' eyes now black buttons give a clue that something isn't quite right.Selick has created a world as much for adults as children as there are references dotted throughout that the young won't understand. The imagery, however, is very child like. Both talents live side by side and bodes well for Selick's previous work in Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach and even Monkeybone.

323,Coraline,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2422076/,"The Movie Coraline is an animated film well worth watching more than once. SPOILER ALERT The movie starts out introducing Coraline, voice actor Dakota Fanning, who is new to the Pink palace and is soon introduced to the black cat, voice actor Keith David, and Wybie Lovat, voice actor Robert Bailey Jr., who both are stalking Coraline. We then meet her mother Mel Jones, voice actor Teri Hatcher, and her father Charlie Jones, voice actor John Hodgman. Corallines' new life is shown to be less than wonderful as she meets her other tenants and is unable to realize her dream of gardening. Soon she discovers another world, which is much better in every way tailored specifically to Coraline based on information gathered by a spying Coraline doll carried by Coraline unknowingly. The other mother quickly turns villainess, as she is unable to get Coraline to do what she wants. With the help of the black cat, Coraline is able to escape the other mother and return home saving other children's souls who were less fortunate than she was. As well as her parents who were trapped to lure Coraline back to the other world.The movie end with Coraline now happy with her real world and realizing she had everything she needed there all along. The theme of wanting more than what you already have and not seeing how good you have it is common among films today. However, the creative imagination of Coraline takes a spin and makes a very unbelievable situation seem plausible. The motif of the movie is seen often as the theme is drawing on what is real and what is too good to be true. When the sound and lighting are as controlled as in Coraline the Director can really impress upon the viewer a believable world that you can see yourself involved. The songs used make the world's first the regular world and then the other world seem like a place of dreary and boring plainness and then a world of pure imagination yet also terror.

325,21 Grams,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0868320/,"I'm actually the opposite of a drama fan- but this movie really touched me, and although it's quite tough to take in, I loved it.I think above all, one has to bow to Guillermo Arriaga, the writer, as ""21 Grams"" features probably the best script I've ever seen. I guess the story itself is not that new, but the way how it's done is simply excellent. The first, say, 30 minutes are just scraps- moments in the lives of the three main characters that mean absolutely nothing to the viewer (yet). Adding to that initial confusion is the fact that these scraps are not in temporal order so that in the beginning personally I wasn't sure I'd be able to follow- it was more like a music video that's just not making any sense at all. But then the pieces begin to come together just beautifully until in the end you can see the whole picture. Usually in these episode movies everything comes together at once somewhere in the middle of the film, but in ""21 Grams"" the viewer puts the pieces together one after another- like a jigsaw puzzle, and every bit as satisfying when everything's completed. This truly is a masterpiece script-wise, and I've never seen anything like it.That brilliant script is supported by excellent actors. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro are delivering the most convincing acting performance I've ever witnessed. Like when Christina (Watts) screams at Paul (Penn) trying to get rid of all of her anger, frustration, grief and hate: I usually think these emotional outbursts don't seem real on screen, but in this movie it is just deeply touching. I haven't seen ""Mystic River"" yet, but if Sean Penn was as good as he is in ""21 Grams"" then the Oscar finally really went to someone who truly deserved it. And Benicio del Toro really is every inch the wonderful actor his reputation claims (I saw him for the first time but had heard a lot of him before, so I was very curious).Finally, thank you, Mr. Inárritu for putting everything together this nicely.

326,Road to Perdition,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1153871/,"Road to Perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece.

At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling.I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do.

I've bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.(I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him.

328,The Experiment,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1939327/,"'Das Experiment' is loosely based on the Stanford Experiment of 1971. During the original experiment, after intensive psychological profiling, background checks and health tests, 18 volunteers who were mostly students from the Stanford area, were brought to an undisclosed location and split into two groups on the flip of a coin. Nine became prisoners and nine became guards. All were perfectly normal, healthy, middle-class students in their early 20s. The experiment was supposed to last 2 weeks. It lasted 6 days, before being forcibly cancelled due to concerns over the prisoners' safety. In the movie, the same experiment is reapplied in a contemporary setting. A similar thing occurs, only the experiment is never cancelled. 'Das Experiment' is superbly directed; you find yourself feeling angry and frustrated alongside the prisoners, and you even feel yourself routing for them. It's refreshing to watch a film that not only has gravitas, but also an unrelenting emotional charge. There certainly aren't many films that can claim to be as emotionally taxing. The acting is also superb. Every character involved in the experiment, including the psychologists monitoring it, are interesting. They have depth, morals, scruples, fears, anxieties, passions; they have depth. The film gives an interesting insight into the human psyche, and how we are all intrinsically and irrevocably linked to our primal urges to dominate those weaker than us.

'Das Experiment' isn't a documentary it is after all but a thriller, so the outcome is more sensational than in real life.

Then, rather than giving us a shocking ending, which would have been ok, or an ambiguous ending, which would have been better, we are given a cheesy formulaic ending.

Then Washington's character leaves Hawke's alive, and...oh forget it, the list just keeps going.But up until that point, I was so impressed.

334,Primal Fear,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1260851/,"Primal Fear will always be on of the best movies I have ever seen. I remember the first time I saw it, I remember each and every subsequent time and each time it's equally as incredible. As thrillers go this is the be all and end all!! Drop dead powerful performances, a moving story, captivating courtroom drama and scenes and an ending that makes The Sixth Sense look predictable. In this review I WILL NOT reveal the ending in any way, shape or form because if you have not yet seen this movie I would never deprive anyone of the incredible shock that this film delivers. Richard Gere is one of my favorite actors, always has been. He has a screen presence rivaled by very few and his performance in Primal Fear is no exception. Martin Vail will always be one of his best performances. Vail is conceited, hopelessly stuck on his own ego. He believes himself to be unparalleled in the world of law and he can't wait to sink his teeth into the media story of the century. A young man and alter boy has been arrested following a brutal murder of a beloved arch bishop. Perplexing thing is this boy is the most soft spoken, stuttering, quiet, innocent boy Vail has ever seen and he immediately sees fame attached to this case. Without a doubt Gere's character goes through the greatest transformation in this film as he quickly discovers the difference between truth and lies, defense and offense and that not everything is black and white.Primal Fear is the story on many levels of people who wear ""masks"", different sides of themselves to different people. Each character wears a different mask throughout the film. Vail wears the mask of being pompous and confident but in fact is scared, fragile, and emotional. The defendant Aaron wears the mask of being the innocent, scared little boy but has the evil alter personality that protects him. Laura Linney's character Janet Venable also wears the mask of being a confident, strong lawyer while in fact feeling her world is falling apart and of course the victim himself Bishop Rushman who to the city was a beloved man who helped many but in fact performed horrible perverted things on his children behind closed doors. Laura Linney is quite good as the rather shaken prosecutor who is really fighting for her job in trying to vindicate Aaron while taking on her former love Vail in the courtroom. She has something to prove and a huge chip on her shoulder and makes for some intense debates in the courtroom between Gere and Linney. Frances McDormand is also very good as Aaron's psychiatrist Dr. Arrington, she's very believable and handles the role with great intelligence. All these amazing performances in this film and they still don't even come fathoms close to touching that of then newcomer Mr. Edward Norton in his Academy Award (and hugely deserved) nominated role as Aaron Stampler and his protective, brash, angry, violent alter personality Roy. Norton is so believable as Stampler and to watch his scary transformation to Roy, his performance draws you in exactly like he's doing for the main characters in the film. You're feeling everything that Martin Vail is feeling as you watch this movie. Every single person's performance in this film is so brilliant that it adds into one amazing film. Other notable smaller performances are Maura Tierney, Alfre Woodard, John Mahoney, and the great Andre Braugher. None of these performances should be ignored.Director Gregory Hoblit at the heart makes a courtroom drama with lots of behind the scenes investigation that puts the action and thrill into the film. But that doesn't stop when it hits the courtroom. The drama and fire ignites in the courtroom with the battle back and forth, further facts, new evidence, a story unfolding before us about this Bishop and his brutal murder. From beginning to end this is one entertainment at it's absolute best. In my opinion I state this as one of the greatest films ever period!! It's absolutely one of my top ten for certain. It's just powerful, moving, well acted and thrilling. It's exactly what you want a film to be...it's what movies are all about.

335,Primal Fear,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0393135/,"It's not often that viewers get a chance to watch a star being born - that a talented unknown actor's performance that is so spectacular it leads to the A-list in one role is rare: Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, Brad Pitt in Thelma & Louise to name a recent few. But Edward Norton's turn as the ""defendant/victim"" in Primal Fear is one of those ""Wow"" moments that leaves the audience salivating for his next performance. In this feature debut, Norton outdistances his role, as does Richard Gere, in a resurrection no less impressive than Norton's star-making turn. Heretofore, Gere has specialized in assorted intelligent professional cad roles. Here, he gets a chance to inhabit one that not only wears his dubious character on his sleeve, but wears it, drives it, drinks it... revels in it. Yeah, sure somewhere there's a heart of gold, but like his client, the layers on top serve him better, and the heart of gold is tarnished. Gere is at his peak, comfortably, cheerfully inhabiting the role.
Laura Linney deserves extra credit for often being the ice-queen foil which propels the two male characters' development; her own character is rather one- dimensional, but she herself squeezes as much dazzle as she can from it. Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears, it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette; another step in what will (hopefully) someday be film's love affair with her. Wasted, sadly, are fine character actors like John Mahoney, Steven Bauer, Maura Tierney & Andre Braugher who could have lit up the screen had they not been handed scripts with generic character stereotypes.See it to watch the ascension of Norton and Gere.",positive,"[['a chance', 'a star', 'a talented unknown actor', 'performance', 'A-list', 'role', 'Pretty Woman', 'Brad Pitt', 'Thelma', 'Louise'], ['Edward Norton', 'turn', 'defendant/victim', 'Primal Fear', 'Wow', 'the audience', 'next performance'], ['this feature', 'debut', 'Norton', 'role', 'Richard Gere', 'a resurrection', 'Norton', 'star-making turn'], ['Heretofore', 'Gere', 'assorted intelligent professional cad'], ['a chance', 'dubious character', 'sleeve'], ['a heart', 'gold', 'client', 'top serve', 'the heart', 'gold'], ['Gere', 'peak', 'the role'], ['Laura Linney', 'extra credit', 'the ice-queen foil', 'male', 'development', 'own character', 'much dazzle'], ['everyone', 'Gere', 'Vail', 'purrs', 'enough time', 'Linney', 'Janet', 'a drag', 'ubiquitous cigarette', 'another step', 'film', 'love', 'affair'], ['fine character', 'John Mahoney', 'Steven Bauer', 'Maura Tierney', 'Andre Braugher', 'the screen', 'generic character', 'the ascension', 'Norton', 'Gere']]","[['viewers', 'chance', 'star', 'talented unknown actor', 'performance', 'A-list', 'role', 'Roberts in Pretty Woman', 'Brad Pitt', 'Thelma & Louise'], ['Edward Norton', 'turn', 'defendant/victim', 'Primal Fear', 'Wow', 'moments', 'audience', 'next performance'], ['feature debut', 'Norton', 'role', 'Richard Gere', 'resurrection', 'Norton', 'star-making turn'], ['Heretofore', 'Gere', 'cad roles'], ['chance', 'dubious character', 'sleeve'], ['heart of gold', 'client', 'layers', 'top serve', 'heart of gold'], ['Gere', 'peak', 'role'], ['Laura Linney', 'extra credit', 'ice-queen foil', 'male characters', 'development', 'own character', 'much dazzle'], ['everyone', 'Gere', 'Vail purrs', 'ears', 'time for Linney', 'Janet', 'drag', 'ubiquitous cigarette', 'step', 'film', 'love affair'], ['character actors', 'John Mahoney', 'Steven Bauer', 'Maura Tierney', 'Andre Braugher', 'screen', 'scripts', 'generic character', 'ascension of Norton', 'Gere']]"

337,A Few Good Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0307329/,"In one of the most telling scenes in this movie, Navy Lieutenant Commander Jo Galloway (Demi Moore), a lawyer who is helping to defend two Marines on trial for murder, is asked why she likes these guys so much.  And she replies, `Because they stand on a wall, and they say nothing is going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch'.'  Which veritably sums up the sense of duty and honor which underscores the conflict of `A Few Good Men,' directed by Rob Reiner, and starring Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise.  There is a code by which a good Marine must live and die, and it is:  Unit, Corps, God, Country.  But to be valid, that code must also include truth and justice; and if they are not present, can the code stand?  Which is the question asked by director Reiner, who examines the parameters of that code with this film, which centers on the murder of a young Private First Class named William Santiago, who was killed while stationed at the Marine Corps base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  The case draws the attention of Commander Galloway, Special Counsel for Internal Affairs in the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Washington, D.C.  Galloway, taking into consideration the impeccable service records of the two Marines charged with the crime, convinces her superiors that a thorough investigation is warranted in this case, though there are those in high places who would rather see this one plea bargained and put to rest.  	Galloway persists, however, believing that Santiago's death may have resulted from a `Code Red,' a method of disciplinary hazing employed in certain circles of the Corps, though illegal.  And if this was a Code Red, the real question is, who gave the order?  Ultimately, her tenacity prevails, but though Galloway is a seasoned lawyer, she has little actual courtroom experience, so Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Cruise) is assigned to the case, along with Lieutenant Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), with Galloway, as ranking officer, to assist.  Kaffee, the son of a legendary lawyer, has skated through the first nine months of his Naval career, successfully plea bargaining forty-four cases.  Outwardly upbeat and personable, Kaffee seems more concerned with his softball game than he does with the time he has to spend on the job.  But underneath, he's coping with living his life in the shadow of his late father's reputation, which is an issue with which he must come to terms if he is to successfully effect the outcome of this case.  And on this one he will have a formidable opponent:  Colonel Nathan R. Jessup (Nicholson), who commands the base at Guantanamo.	As Jessup, Nicholson gives a commanding performance, and once he enters the film you can sense the tension he brings to it, which begins to swell immediately, and which Reiner does a great job of maintaining right up to the end.  Jessup is a soldier of the old guard, a man of narrow vision and a particular sense of duty; to Jessup there's two ways of doing things:  His way and the wrong way.  He's a man who-- as he says-- eats breakfast three hundred yards away from the enemy, and he's not about to let a couple of lawyers in dress whites intimidate him.  And that's exactly the attitude Nicholson brings to this role.  When he speaks, you not only hear him loud and clear, you believe him.  It's a powerful performance and, as you would expect from Nicholson, entirely convincing and believable.	Cruise, also, gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career as Kaffee.  He perfectly captures the aloofness with which Kaffee initially regards the case, as well as the determination with which he pursues it later.  Cruise is convincing in the role, and some of the best scenes in the film are the ones he plays opposite Nicholson in the courtroom, the most memorable being one in which Kaffee exclaims to Jessup, `I want the truth!' to which Jessup replies, `You can't handle the truth!' And the atmosphere fairly crackles.  	Moore is outstanding, as well, and she manages to hold her own and make her presence felt even in the scenes dominated by Nicholson and Cruise.  It's a fine piece of acting by Moore, who deserves more than just a passing mention for it.  Also turning in notable performances are Pollak, whose dry humor adds such an extra touch to the film, and Wolfgang Bodison, who makes an impressive screen debut as Lance Corporal Dawson, on of the Marines on trial for the murder of Santiago.	The supporting cast includes Kiefer Sutherland (Kendrick), Kevin Bacon (Ross), James Marshall (Downey), J.T. Walsh (Markinson), Cuba Gooding Jr. (Hammaker) and Christopher Guest (Dr. Stone).  A powerful drama, superbly delivered by Reiner, `A Few Good Men' is a thought provoking, unforgettable motion picture that makes you take pause for a moment to consider some things that are for the most part out of sight and out of mind.  Like who is on that wall tonight, and are we safe because of him.  And it makes you reflect upon some things perhaps too often taken for granted.  And that's what really makes this film so good; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies.

339,Barton Fink,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291215/,"Spoiler Alert 98% of the above user comments have totally missed the idea of this movie, and yet some have gotten it exactly correct without even realizing it. Here is THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MASTERPIECE MOVIE...Those that stated that the first 2/3 of the movie is boring and then it starts to pick up when the action begins, have unwittingly seen the plot, and masterfully fulfilled its premise. See, Barton Fink is a boring, artsy, impassioned Jewish writer, that gets one lucky break, and is instantly summoned to write a movie that the execs are sure ""will be a winner"" (no pressure there, right Hollywood?). But since he is so much an ""artist"", he cannot lower himself to the level of writing a simple wrestling film, desiring instead to write witty stories about ""the common man"", films that ""really mean something"". Then he refuses to listen to common man stories, stuck instead on his own ideas of what that should be. Well, OK, what is obvious here? Well the Coens for one, are Jewish WRITERS/ FILMMAKERS, who got one lucky break, ""Blood Simple"", and then were given the open door to make Hollywood films, are always branded as mere ""artists"", too idealistic for the majority of the masses (their movies are rarely fully appreciated or understood, and make only a small profit, but their genius high critic ratings keeps them afloat). So THEY ARE Barton Fink, quite literally and intentionally. It is THEIR personal tale, ensconced in a symbolic cloak. Summary: Barton wants to write for the common man, and yet what the common man wants to see is this dumb ""B""-rated wrestling flick, not some heartfelt idealistic piece about some friendly yokel. They want predictable mystery, unadulterated violence and blood, guns blazing, detectives crunching, and loud sex. As Barton stares at the image of his idealism (the beach picture), he longs for his ill conceived idealism to take form and materialize onto the paper. But of course it is a failure, because he sees himself as an ""artist"", not as a business man with epic visions. Which is why finally, the mysterious Audrey (the real writer he is supposed to consult), who always helps Mayhew's stories out of a jam, becomes the catalyst for this story as well, by initiating the sex/horror/detective story as soon as she is asked to. Normal writers apparently are like either Fink or Mayhew, but she sees through to what makes for real-world successful writing (not some dorky contrived ""common man"" story), and she initiates the final action-filled finale immediately. This is PURE GENIUS! ""Adaptation"" as one user here mentioned is like this film, because of the similarity in how the plot loops back in on itself. But this one is much more subtle, to the point where the ""common man"" would not even understand this movie, and thereby fulfill its message, that all people want are the action films that Hollywood dishes to us, just like the mogul states over and over, and we see delivered on the last third of the celluloid. In the end, Fink realizes his idealism, that what he really wanted is to get his artistic view rejected, so that he can maintain his idealistic (unrealistic) outlook, which is his true passion, the ""fight"" for self fulfillment. This is personified by the appearance of the girl on the beach, with Fink still not realizing what would be in the box, because he doesn't comprehend Hollywood thinking or action movies (or ""mainstream"" movies or plots).

340,Miller's Crossing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3120836/,"The Coen brothers craft a loving homage to gangster pictures of yore with splendid results. Essentially the plot has Gabriel Byrne as a good - bad guy caught between two rival gangster factions. It's a standard story line that is still providing cinematic water for many a film maker these days, but shot through the Coen prism, with literary astuteness holding court, it's a genre piece of considerable class. A picture in fact that gets better and better with further viewings.When the Coen's are on form they have the skills to make a grade ""A"" thriller and blend it with a sort of dry irony. It's like they bite the hand that feeds whilst praising said genre influences to the rafters, but it works as damn fine entertainment. On a narrative level Miller's Crossing molds the Byzantine with the labyrinthine, keeping the complexities just on the right side of the street from that of art for arts sake.Visually the film is superb, the hard working sweat of the city dovetails impudently with the mother nature beauty of Miller's Crossing the place, a place home to misery, a witness to the dark side of man. All the while Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro and Jon Polito bring an array of characterisations to the party, each one his own man but each craftily proving the folly of man. Marcia Gay Harden, in one of her first mainstream roles, slinks about making the two main boys sweaty, and wonderful she is as well. While Carter Burwell provides a musical score that has a smug (in a good way) self awareness about it.Style over substance? Yes, on formative viewings it is. But go back, look again, see and sample what is not being said.

341,Miller's Crossing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0285539/,"One of the great undiscovered gems of recent movie history.  In my opinion, Miller's crossing is easily the best of the Coen brothers' films, and one of the true classics of American cinema.On the surface, the story of warring gangsters in 1920's America is one that has been told many times before.  But never before has it been handled with such artistry and precision.  The (rather violent) action scenes keep the movie going along at a brisk pace, and the camera work is every bit the equal of ""Fargo"".I became a lifelong Gabriel Byrne fan as a result of this movie, despite his best efforts to disappoint me since.  Byrne's Tom Reagan is a compellingly amoral character, who takes more unchallenged beatings than perhaps anyone in film history.  Men beat him up.  Women beat him up.  Collection men, bookies, gangsters, and even his boss gives him a terrible thrashing, and he hardly lifts a finger in opposition (with one notably humorous exception).Albert Finney is tremendous as Leo, the local crime boss.  His ""Danny Boy"" scene should go down in film history as one of the greatest pieces ever filmed.  Jon Polito is at once absurdly funny and threateningly psychotic as Johnny Caspar, Leo's rival in the turf war.  J.E. Freeman, John Turturro, and Marcia Gay Harden all lend strong support in a cast that was assembled and performs to near perfection.I will never understand why this film has not received more recognition and acclaim.  As an example of the modern style of Film Noir, it has no equals (""The Usual Suspects"" would rate a close second).  Among gangster films, only ""The Godfather"" can compete, and ""Miller's Crossing"" features superior pacing and dialog, although it lacks ""The Godfather's"" epic proportions. Perhaps someday this film will receive, like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Touch of Evil"", the belated accolades it so richly deserves.",positive,"[['recent movie', 'history'], ['opinion', 'Miller', 'crossing', 'Coen', 'American cinema.On', 'the surface', 'the story', 'America'], ['such artistry', 'precision'], ['violent', 'action', 'the movie', 'a brisk pace', 'the camera', 'work', 'every bit', 'Fargo', '.I', 'Gabriel Byrne', 'fan', 'a result', 'this movie'], ['Byrne', 'Tom Reagan', 'amoral character', 'anyone', 'film', 'history'], [], [], ['Collection', 'boss', 'a terrible thrashing', 'a finger', 'opposition', 'humorous exception', '.Albert', 'Finney', 'Leo', 'the local crime', 'boss'], ['Danny Boy', 'scene', 'film', 'history'], ['Jon Polito', 'Johnny Caspar', 'Leo', 'rival', 'the turf war'], ['J.E'], ['Freeman', 'John Turturro', 'Marcia Gay Harden', 'strong support', 'a cast', 'perfection.I', 'this film', 'recognition', 'acclaim'], ['an example', 'the modern style', 'Film Noir', 'Suspects', 'rate', 'a close second'], ['Godfather', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'superior pacing', 'dialog', 'Godfather', 'epic'], ['this film', 'Candidate', 'Touch', 'Evil']]","[['great undiscovered gems', 'movie history'], ['opinion', 'Miller', 'crossing', 'Coen brothers', 'films', 'true classics', 'American cinema.On', 'surface', 'story', 'gangsters', 'America', 'many times'], ['such artistry and precision'], ['violent', 'action scenes', 'movie', 'brisk pace', 'camera work', 'bit', 'Fargo', '.I', 'Gabriel Byrne fan', 'result', 'movie', 'efforts'], ['Byrne', 'Tom Reagan', 'amoral character', 'unchallenged beatings', 'anyone in film history'], ['Men'], ['Women'], ['Collection men', 'bookies', 'gangsters', 'boss', 'terrible thrashing', 'finger in opposition', 'humorous exception', '.Albert Finney', 'Leo', 'crime boss'], ['Danny Boy', 'scene', 'film history', 'pieces'], ['Jon Polito', 'Johnny Caspar', 'Leo', 'rival', 'turf war'], ['J.E'], ['Freeman', 'John Turturro', 'Marcia Gay Harden', 'strong support', 'cast', 'performs', 'perfection.I', 'film', 'recognition and acclaim'], ['example', 'style of Film Noir', 'equals', 'Usual Suspects', 'rate', 'close second'], ['gangster films', 'Godfather', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'superior pacing and dialog', 'Godfather', 'epic proportions'], ['film', 'Manchurian Candidate', 'Touch of Evil', 'accolades', 'richly deserves']]"
342,The Name of the Rose,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2091132/,"A lot of our perception of the Middle Ages comes from previous Hollywood movies, such as Robin Hood and Excalibur. In reality, Europe of the Middle Ages was dark, damp, and dirty, there was no middle-class, and the clergy and the nobility ran society like dictators. Consideration of personal hygiene was almost non-existent, medical practices were atrocious, and the search for knowledge was discouraged by the church. Aside from the great Gothic cathedrals, much of the architecture was comprised of either large stone buildings or small shacks for the peasantry. And religious fanaticism raged all over Christendom. If you weren't fearing for your life in the hereafter because of sin, you might be worried that the church would haul you in on charges of heresy. But there was one small consolation: it was the period when some of the most beautiful books ever created first appeared by the artistic hands of monks in scriptoriums. This is the world of ""The Name of the Rose"", the film adaption of the novel by Umberto Eco.The story concerns several murders that take place in a medieval monastery circa 1327. But this monastery is special (although essentially fictional): it contains one of the greatest and most extensive libraries in all of Medieval Europe. Not all aspects of the Middle Ages were gloom and doom. The age produced some of the most extravagantly beautiful hand-written books western society has ever seen. The large ornamented calligraphy was adorned by beautiful illuminations in the margins, artwork that surrounded the text. (The art of hand illumination has been subsequently lost to modern printing innovations.) William of Baskerville (Sean Connery), a Franciscan monk, and his pupil Adso (Christian Slater) arrive at this Benedictine monastery hidden in the snow-clad mountains presumably near the border of Italy and modern-day Switzerland. At this time, the Franciscans were a relatively new monastic order, their order barely 100 years old, as compared to the Benedictines that by this time had boasted an 800-year history. William and Adso learn about the death of one of the monastery's best illuminators who worked in the monastery's scriptorium. The scriptorium was the area of a medieval monastery in which monks copied, illuminated and illustrated books. The story becomes a narrative about medieval books, classical writings, and the power of thought--medieval thought versus classical (aka Ancient Greek) sensibilities. As William of Baskerville (so-named referencing Sherlock Holmes) begins to piece together the puzzle, he realizes that the death has much to do with the library and its books, and possibly one book in particular.Although this is a loose adaption of the book, the film ""The Name of the Rose"" is one of the best depictions of the Middle Ages. Unlike most Hollywood offerings concerning the same period, the actors in ""The Name of the Rose"" were probably similar to the strange-looking and care-worn monks that habituated 14th-century monastic life. Most of these people (save the two Hollywood actors Sean Connery and Christian Slater) are gaunt and less unattractive people occupying large drafty buildings full of stench and grime. Their lives amounted to sleeping, eating, working, and worship. Leisure was not just avoided, it was largely unknown. Their only solace is the beautiful Gregorian Chant that echos through the Church Sanctuary during morning and evening services.No one in this movie is particularly attractive, and there are even a character or two who will make you cringe. The cast, mostly made up of French, Italian, and American actors, is outstanding with a few notable standouts. Ron Perlman as Salvatore, a dim-witted hunchback who doesn't know whether he's speaking Latin, Italian or French is the absolute tour-de-force performance of the film. His portrayal is worth the price of admission alone. I didn't realize the actor was actually American until much later! Feodor Chaliapin as the venerable Jorge, an aging blind monk that does not let his age nor his blindness interfere with his expressing opinion gives a stalwart performance. Volker Prechtel as the stoic librarian and supervisor of the scriptorium; his character could give any modern-day spinster a run for her money. William Hickey as Ubertino of Casale, an exiled Franciscan who is strangely lovable despite his age and his dying teeth! And F. Murray Abraham (of Salieri fame in Amadeus) is also memorable as the historical figure Bernardo Gui, a true-to-life 14th-century inquisitor. You really believe you are walking in the 14th century among these people. But would you want to invite them for coffee?This is an outstanding film, granted not exactly escapist and definitely not for the feint of heart. Simultaneously, this movie provides a window into the world of Western Europe 700 years ago, when democracy did not exist, people were stratified, religious fanaticism the norm, and the world was lit only by fire. A compelling time and a compelling subject. Personally I love to study Middle Ages and its history and culture. Would I ever want to live back then? Not on your life. I'll use movies and books instead like the Name of the Rose.",negative,"[['A lot', 'perception', 'Middle Ages', 'Hollywood', 'Robin Hood', 'Excalibur'], ['reality', 'Europe', 'Middle Ages', 'dirty', 'no middle-class', 'the clergy', 'the nobility', 'society'], ['Consideration', 'personal hygiene', 'the search', 'knowledge', 'the church'], ['Gothic', 'the architecture', 'either large stone', 'the peasantry'], ['religious fanaticism', 'Christendom'], ['life', 'the hereafter', 'sin', 'the church', 'heresy'], ['small consolation', 'the period'], ['the world', 'The Name', 'Rose', 'the film', 'adaption', 'the novel', 'Umberto Eco.The', 'story', 'place', 'a medieval monastery', 'circa'], ['this monastery', 'Medieval Europe'], ['Middle Ages', 'gloom', 'doom'], ['The age', 'western society'], ['calligraphy', 'artwork', 'the text'], ['The art', 'hand', 'illumination', 'printing'], ['William', 'Baskerville', 'Sean Connery', 'Franciscan', 'monk', 'pupil', 'Adso', 'Christian Slater', 'Benedictine', 'monastery', 'hidden', 'the border', 'Italy', 'Switzerland'], ['this time', 'new monastic order', 'order', 'this time', 'an 800-year history'], ['William', 'Adso', 'the death', 'the monastery', 'the monastery', 'scriptorium'], ['The scriptorium', 'the area', 'a medieval monastery'], ['The story', 'medieval', 'the power', 'thought', 'medieval thought versus', 'Ancient Greek'], ['William', 'Baskerville', 'so-named referencing', 'Sherlock Holmes', 'the puzzle', 'the death', 'the library', 'book', 'particular.Although', 'a loose adaption', 'the book', 'the film', 'The Name', 'Rose', 'Middle Ages'], ['Hollywood', 'the same period', 'The Name', 'Rose', 'monastic life'], ['Hollywood', 'Sean Connery', 'Christian Slater', 'stench', 'grime'], ['worship'], ['Leisure'], ['only solace', 'Chant', 'Church Sanctuary', 'morning', 'evening', 'services.No', 'this movie', 'a character', 'cringe'], ['The cast'], ['Ron Perlman', 'Salvatore', 'a dim-witted hunchback', 'Latin', 'the absolute tour-de-force performance', 'the film'], ['portrayal', 'the price', 'admission'], ['the actor'], ['Feodor Chaliapin', 'Jorge', 'blind', 'monk', 'age', 'blindness', 'opinion', 'a stalwart performance'], ['Volker Prechtel', 'the stoic', 'supervisor', 'the scriptorium', 'character', 'any modern-day spinster', 'a run', 'money'], ['William Hickey', 'Ubertino', 'Casale', 'an exiled Franciscan', 'age', 'teeth'], ['F.

343,The Name of the Rose,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0979471/,"'Variety' got it completely wrong when they called this film ""sorrowfully mediocre"" and ""sluggishly staged"". For in all honesty The Name of the Rose is one of the greatest films of the '80s, and a film that grows in greatness every time you revisit it. Based on a major bestselling novel by Umberto Eco, the film is an excellent murder mystery further heightened by its authentic period trappings and a clutch of tremendous performances.Brother William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his young apprentice Adso (Christian Slater) are monks who arrive in a 14th Century monastery having been summoned for a religious conference. Soon after their arrival, a series of bloodthirsty murders take place and the friars still alive begin to fear that either the Apocalypse is upon them, or a highly disturbed individual is out to bump them off. Brother William has a penchant for sleuthing, so he probes into the mysterious deaths and discovers that each victim had laid his eyes upon a Greek manuscript hidden deep within the interior of the monastery. He gradually realises that the killer must be targeting those who know of the book's existence, but just as he is about to solve the killings an inquisitor (F. Murray Abraham) arrives and tries to discredit Brother William's theories, preferring to blame the crimes on non-existent heretics and satanists.The film is very realistic in every way - the cold, uncomfortable monastery; the graphic murders; grotesque and disfigured characters; a startlingly explicit sex scene; authentic-sounding dialogue; excellent indoor and outdoor locations; and well-researched costume designs. Furthermore, it is a superbly paced film, never in too great a hurry to unravel but never so slow that it becomes a plod. Connery is great as the hero, surpassed only by Abraham in a breathtaking role as Bernardo Gui the inquisitor, and Slater does well considering his tender age as the loyal apprentice. Both Roy Scheider and Michael Caine were short-listed for the Connery role, but I don't see how either actor could've done better with the character. Jean Jacques Annaud directs outstandingly, capturing every shadow, every expression and every plot piece with the eye that only a director obsessed with his material possibly can.

344,After Hours,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4383325/,"Reviews on the ""After hours"" are quite different, but here it is: once in a couple of years we see a nightmare of being stock in a never ending circle and don't know how to get out of it, but unless other nightmares this very dream turns out to be so adventurous, that it leaves a bitter sweet aftertaste once we wake up and tell about it to our friends. 
I think Scorsese had a similar nightmare right before he came up with the idea of the ""After hours"" movie.
In spite of all the weirdness and troubles the main character goes through during one night, the movie itself is quite watchable thanks to Scorsese's magical skill of creating action and fun wherever possible and impossible.

345,After Hours,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0984851/,"I was living in Los Angeles in the golden '80s, the last great age of American films I think. I watched the video of 'After Hours' so many times it wore out and am happy it is now available on DVD. But I hesitate to buy said DVD. Why? This film is extremely disturbing, and not really a comedy but a gruesome and pitch black snapshot of NYC culture that cuts very close to the bone for those of us who knew the nightlife of Sunset Boulevard on the other side of the country. The similarities between NYC and LA at that time were legion, the only difference being the cavernous, sinister streets of NY were not lined with palm trees. David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' best captures that aspect of danger and tragedy on the west coast that Scorsese has captured on the eastern seaboard. Griffin Dunne has to be the most under-rated American comedian and it is a very good thing his gifts were captured so beautifully in 'After Hours'. His character seems to be the only sane person in Manhattan. He is mostly surrounded a bevy of beautiful and hopelessly neurotic and ruthless women.Rosanna Arquette, a strange actress all on her own, is cast in a very weird part in this film. Nothing she does makes sense which makes her behavior entirely plausible within the circumstances of her environment. Kafka, the author Dunne's character is reading, sets the tone for this dark and dangerous story. Arquette is perfect as the doomed suicide, a sort of modern grand guignol character. She is also tremendously annoying and it's a relief when her whining person is dispatched in the creepy loft she inhabits with Linda Fiorentino. There is a fine performance from Linda Fiorentino (whatever happened to her?), as an s/m style dominatrix/artist in SoHo who leads Paul (Dunne) a merry dance through the darkest bowels of the nightclub scene during the ""punk"" hey-day. Terri Garr, a seemingly sweet and ""normal"" city girl, a blonde, all-American girl living in a sickeningly sweet and Dada-esquire little apartment. She is the most horrifying of all the women Paul encounters. She struck me as being a potential murderess should Paul have decided to linger longer with her. It was a great relief when he escaped her burgeoning hysteria and ran back into the streets. Verna Bloom's motherly artist caps off Paul's horrible journey by encasing him in plaster of Paris and leaving him in a basement flat fit for Frankenstein's monster.John Heard is entirely weird and menacing as a soft-spoken but highly-strung bartender, another mass-murderer waiting to blossom looms in the background of his personality.Scorsese has zeroed in on the familiar things in our lives in a most alarming manner. Cheap bathrooms in cheaply renovated lofts and cramped little apartments. The god- awfulness of the lives of these people is deeply disturbing, and now that I am19 years older than when I first watched this film so avidly, I am not so sure I want to dive back into that vortex of neurasthenia and darkness again.But I probably will. One of Scorsese's best and definitely his most under-rated film.Watch at your own risk.",positive,"[['Los Angeles', 'the last great age'], ['the video', ""'After"", 'Hours', 'DVD'], ['DVD'], [], ['This film', 'a comedy', 'a gruesome', 'pitch', 'black snapshot', 'NYC', 'culture', 'the bone', 'the nightlife', 'Sunset Boulevard', 'the other side', 'the country'], ['NYC', 'LA', 'that time', 'legion', 'the only difference', 'NY', 'palm'], ['David Lynch', 'Drive', 'danger', 'tragedy', 'the west', 'coast', 'Scorsese', 'the eastern seaboard'], ['Griffin Dunne', 'under-rated American comedian', 'good thing', 'Hours'], ['character', 'the only sane', 'person', 'Manhattan'], ['a bevy', 'ruthless women.Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'a strange actress', 'weird part', 'this film'], ['sense', 'environment'], ['Kafka', 'the author', 'Dunne', 'character', 'the tone', 'this dark', 'dangerous story'], ['Arquette', 'the doomed suicide', 'a sort', 'modern grand guignol', 'character'], ['a relief', 'person', 'the creepy', 'Linda Fiorentino'], ['a fine performance', 'Linda Fiorentino'], ['an s/m style', 'dominatrix/artist', 'SoHo', 'Paul', 'Dunne', 'a merry', 'dance', 'the nightclub scene', 'punk', 'hey-day'], ['Terri Garr', 'city', 'girl', 'a blonde', 'all-American girl', 'living', 'Dada-esquire little apartment'], ['horrifying', 'Paul'], ['a potential murderess', 'Paul'], ['a great relief', 'hysteria'], ['Verna Bloom', 'motherly artist', 'Paul', 'horrible journey', 'plaster', 'Paris', 'a basement', 'flat fit', 'Frankenstein', 'monster.John', 'Heard', 'highly-strung bartender', 'another mass-murderer', 'the background', 'personality.Scorsese', 'alarming manner'], ['Cheap', 'cheaply'], ['The god- awfulness', 'this film', 'that vortex', 'neurasthenia', 'darkness', 'again.But'], ['Scorsese', 'under-rated film.Watch', 'own risk']]","[['Los Angeles', ""golden '80s"", 'last great age', 'American films'], [""video of 'After Hours"", 'many times', 'DVD'], ['DVD'], [], ['film', 'comedy', 'gruesome and pitch', 'snapshot of NYC culture', 'bone', 'nightlife of Sunset Boulevard', 'other side', 'country'], ['similarities between NYC', 'LA', 'time', 'legion', 'only difference', 'streets of NY', 'palm trees'], ['David Lynch', 'Drive', 'captures', 'danger and tragedy', 'west coast', 'Scorsese', 'eastern seaboard'], ['Griffin Dunne', 'under-rated American comedian', 'good thing', 'gifts', 'Hours'], ['character', 'sane person', 'Manhattan'], ['bevy', 'women.Rosanna Arquette', 'strange actress', 'weird part', 'film'], ['sense', 'circumstances', 'environment'], ['Kafka', 'author Dunne', 'character', 'tone', 'dark', 'dangerous story'], ['Arquette', 'doomed suicide', 'sort', 'guignol character'], ['relief', 'person', 'creepy', 'Linda Fiorentino'], ['performance from Linda Fiorentino'], ['style dominatrix/artist', 'SoHo', 'Paul', 'Dunne', 'merry dance', 'bowels', 'nightclub scene', 'punk', 'hey-day'], ['Terri Garr', 'city girl', 'blonde', 'girl living', 'Dada-esquire little apartment'], ['horrifying', 'women Paul encounters'], ['potential murderess', 'Paul'], ['great relief', 'hysteria', 'streets'], ['Verna Bloom', 'artist caps', 'Paul', 'horrible journey', 'plaster of Paris', 'basement', 'fit for Frankenstein', 'monster.John Heard', 'highly-strung bartender', 'mass-murderer', 'looms', 'background', 'personality.Scorsese', 'familiar things', 'lives', 'alarming manner'], ['Cheap bathrooms', 'cheaply', 'lofts', 'little apartments'], ['god- awfulness', 'lives', 'people', 'years', 'film', 'vortex of neurasthenia', 'darkness again.But'], ['Scorsese', 'under-rated film.Watch', 'own risk']]"

About halfway through the film, Pacino's constant, unvaried shouting becomes tedious. The film is not a balanced look at police corruption or a compelling character study. We don't connect the loose hip Greenwich Village Serpico with the cop he that is. He never connects with his fellow officers or for that matter anyone, he's too busy shouting them down or doing one of his street theater undercover routines. None of the supporting characters count or make an impression;it's a showcase for Pacino and his character eventually comes off as a self-pitying,self-righteous, prima donna. Lumet and Pacino are better represented by ""Dog Day Afteroon""(1975). And Lumet's ""Prince of the City""(1981) is a more complex,convincing, and focused study of informing and police corruption. On the plus side, Serpico has a good feel for location and provokes thought. Otherwise, it feels dated,the scenes with his living partners are soapy, and those with his parents are moldy. The score by Theodorakis is inappropriate,the dialog ,especially in the domestic scenes, is trite,and the ending disappointments.

347,Serpico,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0131523/,"When Frank Serpico joined the police force he was full of ideals and eager to help bring crime down in his neighbourhood.  He first encounters the corrupt side of his job when he is given an envelope of cash.  Even though he refuses to be part of the take, he finds that it goes too high for him to avoid or ignore.  Meanwhile, his colleagues, who already suspect him of being untrustworthy, begin to suspect him of trying to bring actions against the whole force.  As Scerpio lies bleeding from his head wound, he thinks back over his career.Having read the book several times, I was interested in seeing how such a tomb of a book was brought into a two hour movie. I was pleased to find that the answer to this question was `actually pretty well'.  The film manages to bring off the whole plot by giving the gist and delivering many of the book's most memorable scenes.  There is a problem with the story if you really like the book, but otherwise it works very well.  In fact the way each sequence is important means that the film moves very quickly - it's is often a downside if a film shirks on characterisation, but here it works to the film's favour.Part of the reason the script can get away with little character is that Pacino is really good.  He seems to have fallen into `who-ha' shouting of late, but here he has genuine passion and subtlety in his performance. The support cast includes Roberts, Randolph and others, but really it is Pacino's film and his performance reflects that.Overall this is a tragic true story and it is notable that the film doesn't end with the `and then' text.  There is no happy conclusion to the tale, the corruption that Serpico tried to confront and defeat remains in place after he is finished.

I recently bought the Special Edition and was finally able to appreciate it. Bruce Lee's skills are undeniable (in my opinion).The movie stars with Lee fighting a Shaolin Monk (Sammo Hung). A British agent meets with Bruce after the fight and offers him a mission. Bruce travels to an island fortress ruled by a man named Han. Two friends (Roper and Williams) also arrive at the island for a MA tournament. Throughout the movie they get into numerous fights and manage to take down Han's empire.The movie has some excellently choreographed fight scenes and exceptional acting on Lee's part. What detracts from the movie's glory however is the miscast John Saxon as Roper. He wasn't right for the role and you could tell he only had minimal skills. While I would love to give this 10/10, I just can't.

349,Enter the Dragon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0128694/,"In the years since his bizarre and tragic death, martial arts legend and master Bruce Lee has become a sort of icon within the Kung-fu movie circuit.The last film that he completed before his death, 1973's ""Enter the Dragon,"" has become not only a masterful showcase for Lee's talents (both fighting and acting), but in the 31 years since its release has become perhaps the definitive martial arts movie of all time.Lee, in his first and last English-speaking performance, stars as a martial arts expert who is recruited by the British government to infiltrate an island fortress, under the cover of being invited to a martial arts tournament, to investigate a possible slavery/drug ring led by a former nemesis of his. Indeed something is amiss at this isolated island fortress, as he discovers that his nemesis Han (Shih Kien) is the host of the tournament and is also the leader of the same gang that murdered his sister. Soon enough, Lee, together with two other martial artists, Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly), go to work kicking a** everywhere until the final showdown with the murderous, one-handed villain Han in the classic ""Hall of Mirrors"" fight sequence.""Enter the Dragon,"" a joint American-Chinese production, was intended to be Bruce Lee's introduction to Western audiences, but due to his tragic death just weeks before the film's American release, we will never know what he would have been capable of here in the states. Even more tragically, his son Brandon Lee would experience a similar fate just like his father only 20 years later with ""The Crow.""There are so many classic fight scenes, which I can watch over and over without them ever becoming boring. Many of them still hold up very well, especially by 2004's standards, where fight scenes are mostly digitally enhanced or involve ""wire"" or ""Matrix-fu"" to make up for lack of actual stunt work; plus one has to remember that this film was made in 1973, in the days before wirework would become dominant in today's martial arts cinema. The ""Cavern Fight"" is probably my favorite fight sequence of all time, in any martial arts movie. Many of the fights in this movie, more specially the ones where Lee is involved, have a surreal feeling to them. He brings a kind of grace to his action scenes that have yet to be topped by any actor alive today. Lee even brings many of his own personal philosophies to this film, which makes much sense and perhaps help to understand some of the more philosophical elements to the story. But more than anything, this was Bruce Lee's entrée to Americans; many people, including myself, were introduced to martial arts cinema through ""Enter the Dragon.""There are also several cameos made by future martial arts stars that would eventually reach stardom, most notably Jackie Chan (as a henchman during the ""Cavern Fight"" sequence who has his neck broken by Lee) and Sammo Hung (as Lee's sparring partner in the opening fight sequence).I could go on and on about what makes this movie immortal, but I feel I should let you see what makes it great.

350,Deliverance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0122323/,"Deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by James Dickey, turned into a brilliant movie by John Boorman.

Up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen.

351,Deliverance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3140649/,"SPOILERS! My review is mostly meant for examination by those who have already seen the movie!As others have said this is a truly chilling and sinister film, many so called scary films lose their edge over the years by becoming dated, but this film feels sinister from the beginning and becomes almost unbearably oppressive to watch. Probably what makes it so chilling is the terrible events are entirely plausible.One reviewer here said that this film was about how violence (real violence) affects people, I won't repeat his review because he explains it more eloquently than I, but I totally agree.But interestingly enough as a woman it seemed to me that this movie was also examining masculinity but none of the male reviewers here have mentioned that, so I may be wrong. But I feel this way because it is noticeable to me how differently the men react, compared to women, to trauma. After the male rape not only is it never mentioned again but even initially when Ned is rescued it is not mentioned. I feel women would at least have a cry and hug each other first, but I may be wrong, because shock can manifest in different ways. However all of the men react in the same seemingly unemotional way, of course it is obvious that the men are traumatised by the event but their reaction is to protect their friend and fix the problem. And their way of fixing the problem is by not talking about it. Of course, part of the reason this event can't be discussed is because it is so emasculating. But their caring is obvious in little vignettes, for instance when Jon Voight helps Ned dress after the rape. Why men suppress emotions is something I have not always understood and at times has annoyed me, but this movie was such an insight for me, as I finally got it. We women know how to let out emotion safely, but men are so trained to suppress it that when it does happen it is often like a dam bursting then they can't control it, so it's safer to bottle it up.But the sad thing is though that their suppression will have terrible effects on them, this is one of the reasons therapists often say people shouldn't ""bury"" their problem (never was a metaphor so apt as in this film), however letting it out will make them crack, so they can't win, if they talk about it or suppress it, either way it will affect their sanity.Mind you even as a woman I could understand that many women would want to bottle up an event as traumatic as this one.Depressingly enough most movies when women get raped there is often something still ""sexy"" about the way it is shot but the male rape scene here is so sudden and so chilling you feel their helplessness and you know that if they aren't rescued that they will be killed and horribly, and you know they know this. Often rape reports deal with the violation but this scene really brings home to you the thought of not just the violation but the sheer terror that victims must feel, so I think this scene would be equally illustrative of what both men and women would experience.Even before the rape, it is obvious to me that all these men feel inadequate as men. Macho Lewis is over compensating, whiny Ned boasts about sexual conquests because he knows how unmanly he seems.So they want adventure (ie violence) so to transform themselves into real men, but ironically they don't understand that real violence isn't an adventure. Weirdly enough what should be considered emasculating, the horrible rape Ned experiences, is actually what transforms him into a real man, one who is scared but determined to survive and help his friends.Lewis almost does the opposite he goes from being the strong survivalist (though who undoubtedly saves them) to being terrified and in visible distress from his injury and helplessness.But I don't think the movie is saying that he is a coward. I think the movie shows them all as true human beings, they all show great courage at times but are also reduced to absolute terror at other times as anyone experiencing such horrors would. But that's part of the point is that you can not have true courage without real fear.So unlike the comic book heroes that they wanted to emulate, true heroism evolves from enduring terrible trauma.And it makes me wonder if perhaps one of the reasons that war veterans do not speak of war isn't just because of the horrors they saw but perhaps they are also ashamed of the times that they showed fear, no matter how courageous they may have been, deep down they may feel like cowards.The sad thing is that I think that the characters here will be forever traumatised and feel emasculated by what happened to them but the events were also the making of them as courageous heroes but they probably won't see it that way, but I had no doubt that Ned would go away being stronger, kinder and less brash to others and that Lewis would become more humble and that Jon Voight would appreciate his family more.This is one of the few movies I've seen adult male rape in, and society rarely mentions it too. I think issues such as this should be explored more in cinema, so that men who have experienced such terrible trauma can at least feel that the issue is being addressed in some way. Because let's face it part of the reason why Ned and the other characters can't speak about the rape is because society has deemed adult male rape to be an unspeakably shameful subject.",positive,"[['SPOILERS'], ['review', 'examination', 'the movie', 'sinister', 'film', 'edge', 'this film', 'sinister', 'the beginning'], ['plausible.One reviewer', 'this film', 'violence', 'real violence', 'review', 'a woman', 'this movie', 'masculinity', 'none', 'the male'], ['this way'], ['the male', 'rape', 'Ned'], ['a cry', 'shock'], ['unemotional way', 'course', 'the event', 'reaction', 'friend', 'the problem'], ['way', 'the problem'], ['course', 'part', 'the reason', 'this event'], ['caring', 'instance', 'Jon Voight', 'Ned', 'dress', 'the rape'], ['something', 'this movie', 'an insight'], ['emotion', 'a dam', 'the sad thing', 'suppression', 'problem', 'a metaphor', 'this film', 'either way', 'sanity.Mind', 'a woman', 'an event', 'something', 'the way', 'the male rape', 'scene', 'helplessness'], ['Often', 'rape', 'deal', 'the violation', 'this scene', 'home', 'the thought', 'the violation', 'the sheer', 'terror', 'this scene', 'the rape'], ['Macho Lewis', 'whiny', 'Ned', 'adventure', 'ie violence', 'that real violence', 'an adventure'], ['emasculating', 'the horrible rape', 'Ned', 'a real man', 'friends.Lewis', 'the opposite', 'the strong survivalist', 'visible distress', 'injury', 'helplessness.But', 'the movie', 'a coward'], ['the movie', 'great courage', 'terror', 'anyone'], ['part', 'the point', 'true courage', 'real fear.So', 'the comic book', 'true heroism', 'terrible trauma.And', 'war', 'war', 'fear', 'no matter', 'sad thing', 'the making', 'that way', 'no doubt', 'Ned', 'Lewis', 'Jon Voight', 'family', 'more.This', 'adult', 'male rape', 'society'], ['cinema', 'the issue', 'some way'], ['let', 'face', 'part', 'the reason', 'Ned', 'the rape', 'society', 'adult male rape', 'an unspeakably shameful', 'subject']]","[['SPOILERS'], ['review', 'examination', 'movie', 'others', 'sinister film', 'scary films', 'edge', 'years', 'film feels sinister', 'beginning'], ['terrible events', 'plausible.One reviewer', 'film', 'violence', 'real violence', 'people', 'review', 'woman', 'movie', 'masculinity but none', 'male reviewers'], ['way', 'men', 'women'], ['male rape', 'Ned'], ['women', 'cry', 'shock', 'different ways'], ['men', 'unemotional way', 'course', 'men', 'event', 'reaction', 'friend', 'problem'], ['way', 'problem'], ['course', 'part', 'reason', 'event'], ['caring', 'little vignettes', 'instance', 'Jon Voight', 'Ned dress', 'rape'], ['men', 'suppress emotions', 'something', 'times', 'movie', 'insight'], ['women', 'emotion', 'men', 'dam', 'sad thing', 'suppression', 'terrible effects', 'reasons therapists', 'people', 'problem', 'metaphor', 'film', 'way', 'sanity.Mind', 'woman', 'many women', 'event', 'movies', 'women', 'something', 'way', 'rape scene', 'helplessness'], ['Often rape reports deal', 'violation', 'scene', 'home', 'thought', 'violation', 'sheer terror', 'victims', 'scene', 'men and women', 'rape', 'men', 'men'], ['Macho Lewis', 'whiny Ned', 'sexual conquests', 'adventure', 'ie violence', 'real men', 'real violence', 'adventure'], ['emasculating', 'rape Ned experiences', 'real man', 'friends.Lewis', 'opposite', 'strong survivalist', 'visible distress', 'injury and helplessness.But', 'movie', 'coward'], ['movie', 'true human beings', 'courage at times', 'terror', 'times as anyone', 'such horrors'], ['part', 'point', 'true courage', 'real fear.So', 'book heroes', 'heroism evolves', 'terrible trauma.And', 'reasons', 'war veterans', 'war', 'horrors', 'times', 'fear', 'matter', 'cowards.The', 'sad thing', 'characters', 'events', 'making', 'courageous heroes', 'way', 'doubt that Ned', 'others', 'Lewis', 'Jon Voight', 'family more.This', 'few movies', 'adult', 'male rape', 'society'], ['issues', 'cinema', 'men', 'such terrible trauma', 'issue', 'way'], ['let', 'face', 'part', 'reason', 'Ned', 'other characters', 'rape', 'society', 'adult male rape', 'shameful subject']]"

353,The French Connection,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070258/,"This is an intense, unremitting, intelligent and incredibly fast-paced film which blends action, cinematic realism, art and humor into a masterwork of hard-edged crime drama. But to categorize this film as drama, suspense or action really does violence to it. This is just a great film, and it doesn't fit comfortably into any category with which I am aware. Don't look here for any sense of fantasy-justice or n'er-do-wrong comic book heroism. Look here instead for gut wrenching nihilism, frustration with the unfairness of criminal justice in the hands of bureaucracy, and a solid, plot-driven story about a couple of cops who are just trying to do their jobs as best they can.And by all means, don't watch this film if you aren't fully awake and willing to be taken down the electric, ambiguous, and compelling roads it leads to. If you watch this film with any part of your brain turned off you'll end up asking questions like ""plot, what plot?"" The fact that some people can't find it reflects more on them as film-watchers than it does on this film. This film does not offer passive entertainment like most of the contemporary action market does. It makes you pay attention, though, at times you might not want to. Hackman and Scheider are incredible, with some of the greatest chemistry I have ever seen between two young actors. They play two hard-ass NYC detectives looking to end the war on drugs more-or-less permanently by taking down an international conspiracy which they have just barely sniffed out. And make no mistake, they, particularly Hackman's ""Popeye Doyle"" are at war, and treat their jobs as a battlefield. Doyle pursues his quarry with utterly wreckless abandon, endangering the lives of dozens of people along the way. While both men are absolutely terrific, this stands out as one of Hackman's greatest performances, and his Oscar is well-deserved (not something you will see me say often). Backed by a strong supporting cast, and some of the best live-action cinematography of the late 20th century, this film does not allow you to turn away, get popcorn, or even deal with bodily functions for its entire duration.Considered in the early 70s to be 'shockingly violent', this film does not even reach a tenth the degree of passive violent repulsion of the average Tarantino film, and it relies, instead, on amazing performances, flawless direction, a phenomenal post-modern soundtrack and edgy, tense camera-work. Unlike contemporary action film garbage, it also gives you complex characters who you can care about, but never fully understand.

354,Dirty Harry,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1461536/,"The late sixties and seventies saw the growth of the ""tough cop"" thriller. In earlier crime thrillers (""White Heat"", from the late forties, is a good example) the police had generally been portrayed as honourable and incorruptible men who did everything by the book. The new breed of heroes were different. They were not only tough but also morally ambiguous, capable of bending and even breaking the rules when they thought it was necessary.Before making ""Dirty Harry"", Clint Eastwood had acted in another film of this type, ""Coogan's Bluff"". Both films had the same director, Don Siegel. ""Coogan's Bluff, however, is a lightweight film, with a rather annoying hero who likes to cut corners because he cannot be bothered to go through the proper channels. My sympathies are with Lee J. Cobb's old-school New York cop, irritated beyond measure by Coogan's impatience and cowboy brashness.In ""Dirty Harry"" much more important matters are at stake. A serial killer calling himself ""Scorpio"" is terrorising San Francisco by carrying out killings at random. Some of his victims seem to have been chosen on the basis of religious or racial bigotry, but Scorpio's main motive is blackmail; he will stop killing if the city authorities pay him $100,000. When this blackmail fails, Scorpio kidnaps a young girl, buries her underground with a limited supply of oxygen and announces that he will let her die if his demands are not met. Reluctantly, the authorities agree to hand over the money.The police officer on the case is Inspector Harry Callahan, nicknamed ""Dirty Harry"", partly because of his uncompromising methods and partly because he gets the jobs other officers don't want. Disgusted by the willingness of the authorities to meet Scorpio's demands, Harry tracks down the main suspect, arrests him after shooting him in the leg, finds the murder weapon and forces him to reveal the girl's whereabouts (unfortunately too late to save her life). Although there can be no doubt of the man's guilt, the city's Mayor and District Attorney order his release because the evidence against him is inadmissible; Harry had no warrant to search his premises and the confession obtained by strong-arm methods would not be admissible in Court. Scorpio's narrow escape does not, however, persuade him that crime does not pay, and soon afterwards he kidnaps and holds hostage a busload of schoolchildren. Only Harry can save them In some ways Harry is an unsympathetic character. He is cool to the point of coldness and always has an air of menace about him, particularly during the famous ""Do you feel lucky?"" speech. Some of his dialogue suggests that he is racially prejudiced himself. Clint Eastwood made the role so much his own that it is strange to think he was only fourth choice after Frank Sinatra, John Wayne and Paul Newman. It is doubtful whether any of those actors could have played the part so well. Sinatra might have made him too unsympathetic. Newman could have conveyed his coolness but might not have had the same underlying menace. Wayne (as he was to prove in ""Brannigan"" a few years later) was definitely too old for a role of this type.This film has always been controversial, with critics divided along ideological lines. (The film-makers seem to have intended a deliberate juxtaposition of Harry's values with those of the city of San Francisco which, during the hippie era, was becoming known as America's most liberal city). Liberals such as Roger Ebert have loathed Harry, seeing him as a man who thinks himself above the law, even a fascist. They note that his treatment of Scorpio violates (as the DA points out) at least three, and possibly four, constitutional amendments. (Such liberal critics are divided as to whether the film condemns or condones Harry's methods). Conservatives, however, see him as a hero, a man who will defend the public from crime while his superiors seem more concerned to defend the criminals. They point out that the seventies liberals who were so quick to condemn Harry for acting in breach of the constitution did not apply the same literal-minded legalism to, say, those who were resisting the (constitutionally permissible) Vietnam draft or to civil rights protesters who were engaged in civil disobedience against (constitutionally tolerated) racism in the Southern states.""Dirty Harry"" is much more than a cop thriller; it is a film that asks some important questions. It may seem odd to compare a tough cop with draft resisters or with civil rights campaigners, but Harry faces a moral choice similar to that confronting those two groups of people. In each case the central question is ""If there is a conflict between the two, should one obey the law of the land or should one obey one's own conscience"". This is a question to which there is often no easy answer and is particularly acute for Harry because, as a police officer, he is duty-bound to uphold the law. The law states that he should not carry out a search without a warrant and that he should not use force to obtain a confession from Scorpio. His conscience tells him that he must do both these things to save an innocent life.The German dramatist Friedrich Hebbel once remarked that tragedy does not arise out of the conflict of right and wrong. It arises out of the conflict of two rights. This is the situation which we see in this film, which means that both the liberal and conservative viewpoints quoted above are right- and both are wrong. The law is right to impose limits on police powers, in order to protect the citizen from abuse of those powers by corrupt or over-zealous officers. And Harry is right to go beyond those limits in an effort to save a life. 8/10",negative,"[['the growth', 'tough cop', 'thriller'], ['crime', 'White Heat', 'a good example', 'the police', 'everything', 'the book'], ['The new breed'], ['bending', 'Dirty Harry', 'Clint Eastwood', 'another film', 'this type', 'Coogan', 'Bluff'], ['the same director', 'Don Siegel'], ['Coogan', 'Bluff', 'a lightweight film', 'hero'], ['Lee J.

It is one of my personal favorite action movies of all time.Dirty Harry (1971) is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece and one of his best movies including the best memorable character! The movie that started it all! It is the best action thriller film from Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel! Clint at his asskicking best! It is my favorite best film from Clint Eastwood and the first best one in the series. Even tough he did not directed this film he gave us one if his best performances ever! I love all Dirty Harry movies but this one is a classic and the best in the series. It has action suspense from end till beginning. A movie that will make anyone's day, if you feel lucky punk. I have seen the first one 20 times and will argue that it's the best with no question, but it is somewhat a matter of opinion :)""I know what your thinking. Did he fire six shots or just five? We'll Do I feel lucky? We'll do ya punk?"" Harry Callahan's best quotes. This is one classic Clint Eastwood film. He funnels traits of himself into ""Dirty"" Harry: no nonsense, dry humor, some charm and a good logical mind. Andrew Robinson had trouble getting work for a while after this movie because he did such a great job as Scorpio. Getting typecast as a psychopath kind of limits your casting options. Andrew Robinson also played in my favorite action Stallone flick Cobra (1986) and horror flick Hellraiser (1987). He did a great performance ever as a psychotic killer Scorpio. Reni Santoni was also cast in this movie as Harry's partner Homicide Inspector Chico Gonzalez. He also started 15 years later in my action flick Cobra (1986) alongside Andrew Robinson! I can say both of the actors did a fine job playing in bot cop flicks. First one is the best. But, a little bit of background is due. Academy Award-winner Clint Eastwood (""Unforgiven,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"") stars as ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan in this riveting action film that spawned several blockbuster sequels. In this original, Detective Harry Callahan is determined to bring in psychotic killer Robinson, even if he's determined to break some of the rules. Brilliantly filmed for maximum impact. Recently selected by the prestigious American Film Institute as one of the 400 greatest American films of all time and added ""Dirty Harry"" as part of the 50 Greatest Heroes of all time.Dirty Harry is a 1971 American action thriller film produced and directed by Don Siegel, the first in the Dirty Harry series. The basic plot is about catching a serial killer who was based on a Zodiac Killer. This is one of best movies ever. The story is good, acting is brilliant and effects and action scenes are epic. Watch this movie now!!!! Great films stick inside your head,and this one is a brain limpet! The cinematography and evocation of the San Francisco setting are hauntingly memorable,the dialogue taut and sparse and Schifrin's score is still super cool.Don Siegel and Clint must have studied the European stylists because I read Dirty Harry as the finest amalgam of US Noir and 60's new wave. I find echos of Antonioni and Melville in the tight,clean mis en scene and impeccable action sequences honed by Siegel's long Hollywood pedigree. superb.

356,Goldfinger,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2070206/,"One of the strangest things about ""Goldfinger"" is that, although it is probably one of the least action-packed films in the entire series (basically there is the opening, the climax, and a car chase in-between), time flies by when you're watching it. That probably happens because the pacing is so knowingly unhurried, allowing the film to tell a story and the dialogue to take center stage over the action (a lesson that a lot of other Bond films would benefit from). IMO, Sean Connery hit his absolute peak as Bond in the next film, ""Thunderball"", but this is his second-best performance; for those who think that he can't play the ""emotional"" Bond, his often neglected scene with M should be enough proof of the opposite. Goldfinger is a superior villain, often ahead of Bond in his plans, and Oddjob still remains the best henchman in the series - they both receive memorably creative exits! Pussy Galore is one of the most voluptuous Bond girls, and watching her in her figure-hugging outfits is perhaps even sexier than a nude scene would have been. She is also one of the first (if not THE first) women to perform martial arts moves of any type in a theatrically released film. The two Masterson girls are underrated, especially Jill, who apart from being the famous ""golden girl"", manages to create a playful, fun character in about 5 minutes of screen time. The gadgets are among the neatest in the series, especially the ""ejector seat"". John Barry's work is so good that a music-score-only version of the movie would be worth seeing (and listening to). ""Goldfinger"" is filled with classic moments, and, along with ""From Russia With Love"", still remains the highest point the Bond series has reached to this date. *** out of 4.",negative,"[['Goldfinger', 'the entire series', 'the opening', 'the climax', 'a car', 'chase', 'in-between', 'time'], ['the pacing', 'the film', 'a story', 'the dialogue', 'center', 'stage', 'the action', 'a lesson', 'a lot', 'Bond'], ['IMO', 'Sean Connery', 'absolute peak', 'Bond', 'the next film', 'Thunderball', 'second-best performance', 'Bond', 'scene', 'M', 'enough proof', 'the opposite'], ['Goldfinger', 'a superior villain', 'Bond', 'Oddjob', 'henchman', 'the series'], ['Pussy Galore', 'Bond', 'figure-hugging outfits', 'a nude scene'], ['THE', 'any type', 'film'], ['Masterson', 'Jill', 'golden girl', 'fun character', 'screen time'], ['the series', 'ejector seat'], ['John Barry', 'work', 'a music-score-only version', 'the movie'], ['Goldfinger', 'Russia', 'Love', 'point', 'Bond', 'series', 'this date'], ['* *']]","[['things', 'Goldfinger', 'action-packed films', 'entire series', 'opening', 'climax', 'car chase in-between', 'time flies'], ['pacing', 'film', 'story', 'dialogue', 'center stage', 'action', 'lesson', 'lot', 'Bond films'], ['IMO', 'Sean Connery', 'peak as Bond', 'next film', 'Thunderball', 'second-best performance', 'Bond', 'scene with M', 'enough proof', 'opposite'], ['Goldfinger', 'superior villain', 'Bond', 'plans', 'Oddjob', 'henchman', 'series', 'creative exits'], ['Pussy Galore', 'Bond girls', 'figure-hugging outfits', 'nude scene'], ['THE', 'women', 'arts moves', 'type', 'film'], ['Masterson girls', 'Jill', 'golden girl', 'fun character', 'minutes', 'screen time'], ['gadgets', 'series', 'ejector seat'], ['John Barry', 'work', 'music-score-only version', 'movie'], ['Goldfinger', 'classic moments', 'Russia With Love', 'point', 'Bond series', 'date'], ['* *']]"
357,Goldfinger,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3853610/,"Goldfinger (1964) is Quintessential James Bond 007 it is my number one all time favorite James Bond 007 film from Sean Connery. This one, You Only Live Twice and DR. No from Sean Connery are really my top three all time favorite James Bond 007 films. This was originally the first James Bond film I saw as a kid. Goldfinger was also my dad's favorite James Bond film and in years it become a cult classic. Even for 53 year old movie it still a classic the best 007 flick. I love it to death, I am enjoying it and I have so much fun watching it. This movie has so much action, action, action and more action. Sean Connery does an excellent performance as James Bond 007 I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that even the late Sean Connery is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. Everyone who watched this movie know is a really good Bond movie.The reason why is this movie so good: - James Bond has new cool car Aston Martin DB5 build with smoke screen in which can throw a co driver seat out of the car and the revolving licence plate. The car also has other applications such as: 30 calibre machine guns, Tire-shredding blade, Oil smoke and water emitters. Actress Shirley Eaton as the murdered Jill Masterson-"" is one of the most enduring images in cinematic history. The girl is painted with gold and dies. Memorable and cool villains like are: Auric Goldfinger and Oddjob ( Goldfinger's second henchman.) Oddjob wears a Sandringham hat with a sharpened steel rim, he is using it as a lethal weapon in the style of a chakram. The movie has great sexy beautiful girls like Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson and Tania Mallet as Tilly Masterson. Cool dialogues I love it so much.""Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" This was directed by director Guy Hamilton it was his first James Bond 007 film the first two films were directed by Terence Young in which he directed Thunderball next Bond movie after this one. This movie also didn't evolve around SPECTRE this time like was in the first two film it was about a brilliant mastermind criminal in which he planed to blow off Fort Knox to get more profits for his Gold brilliant! It has beautiful great music score by John Barry I love it. The car Aston Martin DB5 James Bond 007 was driving was so cool, it has so many accessories it was beautiful to watch it.Investigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.This movie has so much impact it is well acted it has great brilliant plot.Gert Fröbe R.I.P was brilliant and excellent as Goldfinger the original villain. He gave his powerful performance as the bad guy from the title of the movie. I love him in this movie.Harold Sakata R.I.P. as Oddjob was great villain just like Goldfinger, he was really strong and excellent in hand to hand combat. Oddjob and Jaws are two great Bond villains.Honor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite, attired in black bra and panties, while she observes Mr. Simmons' (Austin Willis) gin hand through binoculars.What more could you ask for? Well, how about a film in which Bond actually *does* something? For the whole 2nd half of this movie he's just a prisoner who fails every attempt to escape, signal his superiors or even deactivate the bomb himself. Even killing Oddjob at the end is ultimately meaningless as he's still trapped in the vault with a bomb he can't disarm until the Army rescues him.Goldfinger is a 1964 British spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.10/10 Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved me has such a great villains and they are both in my top 10 James Bond favorite films. I just love and enjoy watching this film. Goldfinger in my opinion is MILES way better then Daniel Craig's last three films he did. This movie deserves a cult classic status movies like this will never be so good like was Goldfinger. It is quintessential James Bond 007 action cult classic film I love this movie to death it is my number one favorite Sean Connery's James Bond 007 film.",positive,"[['Goldfinger', 'James Bond', 'number', 'all time', 'James Bond', 'film', 'Connery'], ['Live Twice', 'DR.

358,Searching,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4737656/,"At first glance, 'Searching' could be written off as a cheap fad of a movie - one that uses gimmicks to suck viewers in so they can feel like they're voyeurs peering into another family's misfortune in this age of social media. While this may be true, there are also some elements of the film that don't feel too exploitive.John Cho's portrayal of a frantic father who must find his lost daughter using clues pieced together from her social networks is admirable. As you can imagine, this is not an easy role to play, and requires being able to tap into a wide range of emotions. We get to learn about his daughter, Margot (Michelle La), at the same time that he does - through numerous video clips, recorded chat sessions, Facebook posts and many other documentation. Throughout this discovery period, Cho demonstrates he's a serious actor - not just Harold Lee.Of course, the fact that all video content that 'Searching' is based on is through second-screen video from - FaceTime sessions to broadcast news streams to live streaming chat sites - is unique. It doesn't make the movie, but it also adds something else to it. That said, the plot is limited and falls into the same trap that mystery dramas often will, with a ridiculous twist that comes out of nowhere and a cliched climax.If 'Searching' does nothing else, it should raise awareness about the dangers of social media, as well as the ways it can also help us in trying times.",negative,"[['first glance', 'a cheap fad', 'a movie', 'one', 'another family', 'misfortune', 'this age'], ['the film', 'Cho', 'portrayal', 'a frantic father', 'daughter'], ['an easy role', 'a wide range'], ['daughter', 'Margot', 'Michelle La', 'the same time', 'numerous video', 'chat', 'Facebook', 'many other documentation'], ['this discovery', 'period', 'Cho', 'a serious actor', 'Lee.Of', 'course', 'the fact', 'all video', 'content', 'second-screen video', 'FaceTime', 'news'], ['the movie', 'something'], ['the plot', 'the same trap', 'mystery', 'dramas', 'a ridiculous twist', 'a cliched climax.If', 'nothing', 'awareness']]","[['first glance', 'cheap fad', 'movie', 'one', 'gimmicks', 'viewers', 'family', 'misfortune', 'age', 'social media'], ['elements', 'film', 'exploitive.John Cho', 'portrayal', 'frantic father', 'daughter', 'clues', 'social networks'], ['easy role', 'range of emotions'], ['daughter', 'Margot', 'Michelle La', 'same time', 'video clips', 'chat sessions', 'Facebook posts', 'many other documentation'], ['discovery period', 'Cho', 'serious actor', 'Lee.Of course', 'fact', 'video content', 'second-screen video', 'FaceTime sessions', 'news streams'], ['movie', 'something'], ['plot', 'same trap', 'mystery dramas', 'ridiculous twist', 'cliched climax.If', 'nothing', 'awareness', 'dangers', 'social media', 'ways', 'times']]"

The shots fired in the shooting scenes were actually synchronised with the soundtrack playing, with that giving the movie a corny / cheesy feeling. Awkward and clichéd one liners, acting from teeny main leads wasn't believable at times. Car scenes were OK, hence 2 stars, the ending was drawn out, felt rushed and discombobulated. I didn't really care for any of the characters tbh, apart from Jamie Fox. Overall this movie felt like watching a teenagers room.

362,Bridge of Spies,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3340477/,"Spielberg knows what he did, but I have a few thoughts. Let's start with the title - You know, there's only one ""spy"" per se, who matters anyway. But it makes it sound like some thriller-diller, eh?Now Tom Hanks - uh, what's with that incredibly furrowed, knit brow all through the story. Makeup Oscar time? Did they borrow it from a Klingon?The woman who plays Donovan's wife? I know she's supposed to be convincingly all 1950s square - but really, heels and full lipstick all the time? Smiling at everything? At least they didn't plug in Jessica Chastain, that would not have been credible opposite Donovan's shlubby character. A performance as flat as one of those pancakes in the big American breakfast he never ate.The youth are not at this movie, they're all out to see the latest vampire/zombie/Tom Cruise dreck. So the boomers out to see an ennobling patriotic drama have lived through all this, including ""duck and cover"" and the Missile Crisis. Do those of us who actually were terrorized and traumatized by all that really need pedantic little lessons about the bombs and the sirens, delivered by Donovan's delusional little genius son? I found it insulting.Of course, all the Russians are scene-chewing geeky monsters, sometimes in such close-up we can see the beet-bits in their teeth.Gosh, it was cold in that Cold War! So we have to see everyone blowing and wiping their noses, boogers hanging, in order to get the idea?Exception: Mark Rylance, the only great thing about the movie. I've been watching Rylance in ""Wolf Hall,"" and it's very impressive how he can create such a level of charismatic tension by hardly doing anything at all. He's all stillness, posture, little eye movements and gazes, all restrained, all coiled in. Amazing.Back to the thriller at hand. So in the big spectacle scene where the U2 gets shot down, did Spielberg really need to show off, proving ""Oh, I can do 'Gravity,' I can do 'The Walk'"" just for bragging cred? And is it actually historically true that Powers gripped on to edge of his crumbling cockpit and just failed to hit the destruct button before his tether broke? (OH! is that a sneaky symbolic allusion to 'aborting' a mission?)This whole thing could have been done as a 15-minute documentary (not that I'd like seeing another documentary) rather than puffed up into a dry and predictable ""drama. When we see Hanks' character lying face down on his bed at home because he's so beat, I suppose if I were him I'd be concerned to hide my face for having accepted another such stereotypical heroic individual little man role.Do nasty CIA agents really skip into the air in peevish excitement like an 11-year old when they get frustrated? (Oh, they probably do.)It might have been more exciting to get into a row with the dopey woman in the seats behind us who kept aggravating my wife by kneeing and bumping the back of her seat - but ""Would it help?""So the Coen brothers helped write this.

363,Bridge of Spies,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3337997/,"This movie hit me really strangely.I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of Spies to be so humorous. The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks.Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure.And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed. Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable.

364,Sicario,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3327522/,"Sicario doesn't live up to the hype. Emily Blunt's character runs around and stumbles upon things like she's Bella Swan from Twilight: New Moon. Benicio Del Toro's character's story is the most interesting part of the movie but, his story doesn't come about until halfway into the movie. Emily Blunt is completely underutilized here; Her character makes some of the stupidest decisions but, some of it is justified. All Emily Blunt really does in this movie is stumble upon things, makes stupid decisions, and smokes a ton of cigarettes. Benicio Del Toro is a bad-ass in this movie and his scenes are the most interesting, but Del Toro's story isn't engaging enough because it is lacking what the rest of the movie is lacking... a story. Sicario plays more on beats, tone, images, and simplicity rather than dramatic story elements and sentimental emotion. This movie is extremely blood soaked, violent, and sometimes haunting, but that's all it has going for it. This movie means nothing, it starts nowhere, and it ends nowhere. The movie is 100% predictable minus a couple of moments with Del Toro towards the end. If you want to see a boring tension-filled blood-soaked horror feast than enjoy.

I knew I'd like it, I'd heard nothing but amazing things, and five minutes into the movie I completely regretted not watching it sooner. Sicario is, hands down, one of the best action/thrillers of the decade. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to create so much suspense and intensity throughout 120 minutes that at times it's almost unbearable. Needless to say, my fingernails did not survive this movie. The plot itself is fairly basic - the FBI teams up with some shady people to fight a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Emily Blunt plays the young FBI agent recruited into the fight, and for most of the movie the audience is just as confused and suspicious as she is. It delivers plenty of wonderful ""what the hell?"" moments, as you never really get a sense of anyone's true motivations until the end. The performances are universally terrific and the dialogue is sharp, but the main reason the movie works so masterfully is Villeneuve. With the help of some striking cinematography and a brilliant score, he gives us one of the most surprising, tense, and atmospheric thrillers in the history of the genre.

366,Hell or High Water,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3539490/,"Yet another film that I was looking forward to seeing, I even had to wait for this one to get to my area (one of the many downsides to living in middle America) Hell or High Water was sure to be a treat. I kept hearing positive reviews of this film, and it stayed at 100% on rotten tomatoes for awhile, so I was hopeful. In addition to the positive reviews, I thought Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges, and Gil Birmingham together couldn't a bad film make. The 2016 feature by David Mackenzie tells the tale of 2 brothers who will stop at nothing to save the land of their deceased mother, the last link to their childhood, and the riches that the oil under her land will promise. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is a Texas lawman weeks before a forced retirement, training Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) to be able to take his place. Just when it seems like it will be a quiet couple weeks before retirement, a rash of bank robberies occur and Marcus and Alberto take the responsibility to solve the case. Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine) have gotten the brunt of many bad situations in their lives. After their mother passed away, they were faced with the realization that the land on which she lived was being seized by the bank. After recently learning that there is a massive amount of oil under that land invigorates the brothers to save the land by any means necessary. Toby has a former wife and a child to think about and believes himself to be indebted to them and wants to gift them the land and the oil so they will always be taken care of. Tanner is constantly on the run, in and out of jail, and has nothing to lose by helping his brother, even if the means are criminal. After weaving together an intricate plan of robbing the very bank responsible for the foreclosure on their mother's land, then securing the deed through that very bank, the two begin an old west style run of bank robberies with a couple of Texas lawmen on their tails. As much as I had been looking forward to Hell or High Water, I was monumentally disappointed. Early in the film, we see over the shoulder of Jeff Bridges' character as he is reading his forced retirement letter from the department; this begins the formulaic downturn suffered through the rest of the film. Each pivotal moment was seen coming a mile away and easily predicted. There are few things more boring than watching a lazy movie in which the audience can predict each move made by the characters, and even each piece of dialogue spoken throughout the entire film. Jeff Bridges was flat on screen, Chris Pine was horribly miscast, and there are Grand Canyon sized holes in character development that are never solved. I never knew enough about the characters to become invested in them. Ben Foster was the only shining spot in this film, but even his exceptional acting couldn't save the film.

370,The Raid: Redemption,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2590108/,"Increasingly now, foreign filmmakers are making better Hollywood action movies than Hollywood is. In this case an English director who evidently now works in Indonesia seems to have mastered all the action story tenets despite this being only his 3rd feature film. Even more, the number of layers to this story parallels the number of floors in the apartment building that is at the centre of this film. All I could think of is how Hollywood will eventually commandeer this film and make a lifeless by-the-numbers knock-off that will only stain the original. And of course, the budget of the original is about the same as a Hollywood B-list movie actor's salary.This film is a disciple of the Asian extreme action genre, with over-the-top karate and acrobatics mixed with guns and violence. Betrayal isn't just a plot twist in these films, it's the first act. At least 5 or 6 betrayals are expected in these type of films where thieves betray other thieves, cops betray other cops, and honest guys get betrayed by best friends. What makes this film a standout is the unflinching action and well choreographed fight sequences by leads Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais. Early Jackie Chan movies got this kind of notice overseas because of their energy and gifted action instincts. Here, Gareth Evans is a one man powerhouse writer, director, and editor, masterminding this intricate chess match of good guys trapped on the sixth floor, with angry thugs coming up from the fifth floor and determined killers descending from the seventh floor. You feel our heroes feel trapped and vulnerable. Evans finds sources of tension from many places. The apartment building has tenants with unknown loyalties. The man heading the raid has unknown motives. Each character is well established with a minimum amount of screen time, keeping the action going.I was urged by a movie reviewer to see this film, describing it as one of the best action movies ever made. And you have to agree, this film, after providing a few minutes of backstory, takes off straight into the police raid of the apartment building filled with bad guys and a gang lord. Cinematography takes lessons from ""Saving Private Ryan"", using hand-held documentary style footage during firefights, and blasting the soundtrack with dozens of loud guns firing at once. The pulsing synthesiser score also hits with the punchy music stabs that propel the momentum as the police troops make their way up to the big bad guy on the top floor.Action sequences are creative and provide new angles and fight tactics that keep the hand-to-hand combat kinetic. Fans of the Bourne movies are encouraged to seek this out. (Not a coincidence that a Bourne Legacy trailer played before this showing). Many human moments also ground this film. An innocent man caught in the crossfire, gets asked to risk his life. A police squad leader who gets frustrated when the man conducting the raid puts his troops at risk. A child hired as lookout for the gang lord must die in order to prevent him from sounding the alarm.There is an intensity to this film that resembles scenes from ""Black Hawk Down"", with very intelligent setups for conflict, and innovative approaches to getting from point A to point B. This fresh drive, propelled by good guy Iko Uwais makes this 1 hour 40 minute film zip along with no time out to catch your breath. The fact this film is subtitled will prevent it from being a widespread hit, although it will no doubt have a long life on DVD. Instead, I expect director Gareth Evans to be directing movies with 150 times the budget of this small gem within a very short time.",negative,"[['Hollywood', 'action', 'Hollywood'], ['this case', 'English', 'director', 'Indonesia', 'the action', 'story', 'feature', 'film'], ['the number', 'this story', 'the number', 'the apartment', 'building', 'the centre', 'this film'], ['Hollywood', 'this film', 'knock-off'], ['course', 'the budget', 'Hollywood', 'B-list movie', 'actor', 'salary.This', 'film', 'a disciple', 'the Asian extreme', 'action', 'genre', 'over-the-top karate', 'violence'], ['Betrayal', 'a plot', 'twist', 'the first act'], ['these type'], ['this film', 'a standout', 'the unflinching action', 'choreographed fight', 'Yayan Ruhian', 'Iko Uwais'], ['Jackie Chan', 'this kind', 'notice', 'energy', 'gifted action'], ['Gareth Evans', 'a one', 'man', 'powerhouse', 'writer', 'director', 'editor', 'this intricate chess', 'match', 'the sixth floor', 'the fifth floor', 'the seventh floor'], [], ['tension'], ['The apartment', 'building'], ['The man', 'the raid'], ['Each character', 'a minimum amount', 'screen time', 'the action', 'going.I', 'a movie', 'reviewer', 'this film', 'action'], ['this film', 'backstory', 'the police', 'raid', 'the apartment', 'building', 'a gang', 'lord'], ['Cinematography', 'Private Ryan', 'hand-held documentary style', 'footage', 'the soundtrack'], ['synthesiser', 'score', 'the punchy', 'music', 'stabs', 'the momentum', 'the police', 'way', 'the big bad guy', 'the top floor.Action', 'fight', 'the hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'kinetic'], ['Bourne'], ['a coincidence', 'Bourne Legacy', 'this showing'], ['this film'], ['An innocent man', 'caught', 'the crossfire', 'life'], ['A police', 'squad leader', 'the man', 'the raid', 'troops', 'risk'], ['A child', 'lookout', 'the gang', 'lord', 'order', 'the alarm.There', 'an intensity', 'this film', 'Black Hawk Down', 'conflict', 'point', 'point', 'B'], ['This fresh drive', 'good guy', 'Iko Uwais', 'hour', 'minute', 'film', 'zip', 'no time', 'breath'], ['The fact', 'this film', 'a widespread hit', 'a long life', 'DVD'], ['director', 'Gareth Evans', 'the budget', 'this small gem', 'short time']]","[['foreign filmmakers', 'Hollywood action movies', 'Hollywood'], ['case', 'English director', 'Indonesia', 'action story tenets', 'feature film'], ['number of layers', 'story', 'number of floors', 'apartment building', 'centre', 'film'], ['Hollywood', 'film', 'by-the-numbers knock-off'], ['course', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'movie actor', 'salary.This film', 'disciple', 'extreme action genre', 'over-the-top karate and acrobatics', 'guns and violence'], ['Betrayal', 'plot twist', 'films', 'first act'], ['betrayals', 'type of films', 'thieves', 'other thieves', 'cops', 'other cops', 'guys', 'friends'], ['film', 'standout', 'unflinching action', 'fight sequences', 'leads Yayan Ruhian', 'Iko Uwais'], ['Jackie Chan movies', 'kind of notice', 'energy', 'action instincts'], ['Gareth Evans', 'one man powerhouse writer', 'director', 'editor', 'chess match', 'good guys', 'sixth floor', 'angry thugs', 'fifth floor', 'killers', 'seventh floor'], ['heroes'], ['Evans', 'sources of tension', 'many places'], ['apartment building', 'tenants', 'unknown loyalties'], ['man', 'raid', 'unknown motives'], ['character', 'minimum amount', 'screen time', 'action going.I', 'movie reviewer', 'film', 'action movies'], ['film', 'minutes of backstory', 'police raid', 'apartment building', 'bad guys', 'gang lord'], ['Cinematography', 'lessons', 'Private Ryan', 'style footage', 'firefights', 'soundtrack with dozens', 'loud guns'], ['synthesiser score', 'punchy music stabs', 'momentum', 'police troops', 'way', 'big bad guy', 'floor.Action sequences', 'new angles', 'fight tactics', 'hand-to-hand combat kinetic'], ['Fans', 'Bourne movies'], ['coincidence', 'Bourne Legacy', 'showing'], ['Many human moments', 'film'], ['man caught', 'crossfire', 'life'], ['police', 'squad leader', 'man', 'raid', 'troops at risk'], ['child', 'lookout', 'gang lord', 'order', 'alarm.There', 'intensity', 'film', 'scenes', 'Black Hawk Down', 'setups for conflict', 'innovative approaches', 'point', 'point B'], ['fresh drive', 'guy Iko Uwais', 'hour', 'minute film zip', 'time', 'breath'], ['fact', 'film', 'widespread hit', 'life on DVD'], ['director Gareth Evans', 'movies', 'times', 'budget', 'small gem', 'short time']]"
371,The Raid: Redemption,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2586247/,"I decided to wait a full day before writing a critical review on this movie to let my emotions die down - In conclusion i have nothing but praise for this movie. If your goal is to walk into this movie and be psychologically challenged or expect great dialogue you will be disappointed. There are some movies that you need to walk into and know little of what will unfold to get the full cinematic experience. I always check the ratings of movies on IMDb before considering watching them and after reading some of the other user reviews on 'high octane' intensity and non stop fight scenes i in the least expected some good action in this movie. Even with that though i thought an entire movie could not be based on fighting scenes and score above an 8 on IMDb (boy was i wrong).This movie is earning glowing reviews because of the action sequences filmed in the movie that place you in a cinematic experience where you actually feel like you are watching real men fight for their lives. It's nothing poetic with backflips and flexible positions but simply man vs man often equipping anything in the room to disarm/disable and kill their opponent. It places you in the hot seat viewing the closest things to actual killings - Now this isn't to say the movie slows down on blood spurts or zooms in when someone is getting their throat sliced - it simply shows it how it is, it's fast, real and intense.In some of the other reviews you hear fans praising the knife fighting scenes. This movie was incredible with it's knife fights and how effective and swift they are in close quarters. The finish was always swiftly at the throat but that wasn't before 2 to 3 lightning touches to the chest/quads or arms to disable an opponent or render them shocked in pain.Heres the bottom line: This movie was made on the smallest budget i've ever seen for any movie to hit international screens. The director and all actors are no names that you have never heard however i guarantee that you will never watch another action film again because the raid is groundbreaking in it's reality/intensity and quality of choreography.Every movie that scores high ratings appeals to a certain group of audiences. This is a very specific movie but is well deserving of the praise it is receiving from our users at IMDb.

373,End of Watch,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3525289/,"I was really excited to see this in theatres, I thought the trailer looked good but I have to admit what really sold it to me was that it was from the writer from Training Day. I'm not big into found-footage movies, there's been so many of them, the gimmick doesn't feel fresh anymore. Even though it wasn't playing anywhere near me, I made the trip with my best friend and we both walked out of the movie with our jaws hitting the floor. It's easily the best found footage movie that I've ever seen and it's also easily the best work of it's writer/director David Ayer.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie begins with a police chase being recorded from a dashboard camera. Officer Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is delivering a monologue about how he's required to take these criminals down. It doesn't matter if he agrees with the law, it's his job to put these guys in a cage. He's chasing these guys with his partner officer Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) and after he's finally run them off the road, there's a shootout. They are able to put these guys down and the tape ends with them waiting for backup.We then join them again at the precinct, in the locker room. Brian introduces himself as an officer of the LAPD. He shows them his locker, the equipment he's carrying on a daily basis and even briefly introduces his partner Mike and another officer Van Hauser (David Harbour). Van Hauser isn't too keen on Taylor taping everything and tells him he's going to report him. Taylor and Zavala laugh it off and head out. Next we see them with the other officers in their division. Their Sargent (Frank Grillo) is assigning them to certain districts in their city and their superior Captain Reese shows up. Reese tells the rest of the unit that Taylor and Zavala were cleared in the shooting of the previous police chase. He doles out the assignments and they head out to try and make a difference.I stated in the opening that found-footage is a gimmick, it's no longer new and exciting and frankly I'm getting tired of it. I bring that up again because for a found-footage movie, End of Watch is really well shot. There are some scenes where there are very cool camera angles, the action scenes are coherent (something that found-footage movies just can't seem to get) and exciting. People have complained that there are bits where its not completely clear who's holding the camera and I won't disagree. But I think the fact that the movie is so well filmed helps you gloss over that and I've never had a problem when watching it.End of Watch has a plot arc but most of the movie feels like what its pretending to be, a sampling of a few days in the lives of these guys. Again, I found this to be more effective than your standard plot line. The stuff these guys have to deal with is crazy and while I'm sure most of the cops in L.A. don't have to deal with all of this on a daily basis, I could see a lot of this going down. It keeps the movie moving at a quick pace and you don't know what's going to happen next.In my opinion what makes this movie special is the interplay between the characters. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are great together and by themselves. You completely buy them as best friends and people who would be hanging out together day in and day out. They're actually really funny in the scenes that they are just driving around and considering how dark this movie gets, its some much needed levity. A lot of the supporting characters do a good job too. Natalie Martinez, Anna Kendrick, David Harbour, America Ferrera and Frank Grillo are all fun to watch in their respective roles. Some people complain about the gang villains and I would agree that their acting isn't terribly strong. I don't have a problem with that though, the movie is about Taylor and Zavala's friendship, not about them taking on the cartel.I've watched this movie more than a few times and I love it each time I watch it. The movie moves quickly, there's a lot of great acting, a believable feel to it and it gives you main characters that you want to root for. I'm so glad I took the time to search it out when it was in theatres and although it didn't get the awards attention that they probably wanted, it does have quite the following. It's easily one of my favourite movies (definitely one of the best in the past few years). It shows the talent that David Ayer has and even though not every movie he's made has been excellent (Sabotage was disappointing), he's very good at what he does and I hope he gets more good projects going forward.",positive,"[['the trailer', 'the writer', 'Day'], ['the gimmick'], ['the trip', 'friend', 'the movie', 'the floor'], ['found footage', 'movie', 'work', 'writer/director', 'David Ayer'], ['Minor Spoilers Ahead', 'The movie', 'a police', 'chase', 'a dashboard', 'camera'], ['Officer Brian Taylor', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'a monologue'], ['the law', 'job', 'a cage'], ['partner', 'officer', 'Mike Zavala', 'Michael Pena', 'the road', 'a shootout'], ['the tape', 'backup.We', 'the precinct', 'the locker', 'room'], ['an officer', 'LAPD'], ['locker', 'the equipment', 'a daily basis', 'partner', 'Mike', 'another officer', 'Van Hauser', 'David Harbour'], ['Van Hauser', 'Taylor', 'everything'], ['Taylor', 'Zavala'], ['division'], ['Sargent', 'Frank Grillo', 'city', 'Captain', 'Reese'], ['the rest', 'the unit', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'the shooting', 'the previous police', 'chase'], ['a difference.I', 'the opening', 'found-footage', 'a gimmick'], ['a found-footage movie', 'End', 'Watch', 'shot'], ['cool camera', 'the action', 'something'], ['the camera'], ['the fact', 'the movie', 'a problem', 'it.End', 'Watch', 'a plot', 'arc', 'the movie', 'pretending', 'a sampling'], ['Again', 'standard plot', 'line'], ['The stuff', 'L.A.', 'a daily basis', 'a lot'], ['the movie', 'a quick pace', 'opinion', 'this movie', 'special', 'the interplay'], ['Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Michael Pena'], ['day', 'day'], ['this movie', 'levity'], ['A lot', 'a good job'], ['Natalie Martinez', 'Anna Kendrick', 'David Harbour', 'America Ferrera', 'Frank Grillo', 'all fun'], ['the gang', 'acting'], ['a problem', 'that though', 'the movie', 'Taylor', 'Zavala', 'friendship', 'the cartel.I', 'this movie', 'each time'], ['The movie', 'a lot', 'great acting', 'a believable feel'], ['the time', 'attention', 'the following'], [], ['the talent', 'David Ayer', 'every movie', 'Sabotage']]","[['theatres', 'trailer', 'writer', 'Day'], ['found-footage movies', 'gimmick'], ['trip', 'friend', 'movie', 'jaws', 'floor'], ['footage movie', 'work', 'writer/director David Ayer'], ['* Minor Spoilers Ahead', 'movie', 'police chase', 'dashboard camera'], ['Officer Brian Taylor', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'monologue', 'criminals'], ['law', 'job', 'guys', 'cage'], ['guys', 'partner officer Mike Zavala', 'Michael Pena', 'road', 'shootout'], ['guys', 'tape', 'backup.We', 'precinct', 'locker room'], ['Brian introduces', 'officer', 'LAPD'], ['locker', 'equipment', 'daily basis', 'introduces', 'partner Mike', 'officer Van Hauser', 'David Harbour'], ['Van Hauser', 'Taylor', 'everything'], ['Taylor and Zavala'], ['other officers', 'division'], ['Sargent', 'Frank Grillo', 'certain districts', 'city', 'Captain Reese'], ['rest', 'unit', 'Taylor and Zavala', 'shooting', 'police chase'], ['assignments', 'difference.I', 'opening that found-footage', 'gimmick'], ['found-footage movie', 'End of Watch', 'shot'], ['scenes', 'camera angles', 'action scenes', 'something', 'found-footage movies'], ['People', 'bits', 'camera'], ['fact', 'movie', 'problem', 'it.End of Watch', 'plot arc', 'movie feels', 'pretending', 'sampling', 'few days', 'lives', 'guys'], ['Again', 'plot line'], ['stuff', 'guys', 'cops in L.A.', 'daily basis', 'lot'], ['movie', 'quick pace', 'opinion', 'movie special', 'interplay', 'characters'], ['Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Michael Pena'], ['friends and people', 'day', 'day'], ['scenes', 'movie', 'levity'], ['lot', 'characters', 'good job'], ['Natalie Martinez', 'Anna Kendrick', 'David Harbour', 'America Ferrera', 'Frank Grillo', 'fun', 'respective roles'], ['people', 'gang villains', 'acting'], ['problem', 'though', 'movie', 'Taylor and Zavala', 'friendship', 'cartel.I', 'movie', 'few times', 'time'], ['movie', 'lot', 'great acting', 'believable feel', 'main characters'], ['time', 'theatres', 'awards attention', 'following'], ['favourite movies', 'past few years'], ['talent', 'David Ayer', 'movie', 'Sabotage', 'good projects']]"
374,The Impossible,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2741557/,"I offer two pieces of advice if going to see ""The Impossible."" 1) Bring Kleenex 2) Bring extra Kleenex.""The Impossible"" is the true story of the Belón family. Mother, father and three children who survived the devastating 2004 Tsunami which ripped apart south-east Asia. There has been some criticism that the film ""Hollywoodized"" the story by ""whitewashing"" the family, but clearly, they have not seen the film. The beauty of this story, written by María Belón and turned into a screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez, may never have been able to be produced had they not been able to bring in big-name stars and get the funding for spectacular special effects, so one must forget the politics and just be truly happy this story made it to the big screen at all in a form which could touch a wide audience.Naomi Watts plays Maria Bennet who, along with her son Lucas, are separated from her husband, Henry (Ewan McGregor) and her other two sons, Thomas and Simon, after the tsunami hits the resort where they were vacationing. This is the true story of how they miraculously survived and found each other.And a reminder of the hundreds of thousands that were not as fortunate.Watts has been nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her riveting performance as Maria, and with reason. The amount of emotion and pain this woman pours into the role makes it easily one of the most heartbreaking of the year. Sadly, she is not a front-runner, but this performance is far more deserving than the woman who is.And I am not one who is generally terribly impressed by younger performers, but if there was any young actor this year who actually deserves an Oscar nomination, it is Tom Holland in the role of Lucas. The depth and feeling that this kid brings to his role is astonishing for someone of his age. Unlike the other young kid that was nominated this year, Holland actually showed some actual skill in his craft and not just merely being, well, a kid.This is not to overlook excellent performances as well by an incredible strong McGregor and, yes, the two younger actors that pulled in much of the emotional weight, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast.""The Impossible"" is an extraordinary journey of the human spirit. Not always easy to watch, but the devastation and pain is worth experiencing. Through the love of this family and the efforts of the people of Thailand, you are brought into an emotional wave almost as strong as the horrific tsunami itself while it drags you through the heartbreak to the bitter end.Take my advice, bring extra Kleenex.",negative,"[['advice', 'Impossible'], ['Bring Kleenex', 'Bring', 'Kleenex'], ['the true story', 'Belón', 'family'], ['Mother', 'father', 'Tsunami', 'Asia'], ['some criticism', 'the film', 'Hollywoodized', 'the story', 'the family', 'the film'], ['The beauty', 'this story', 'María Belón', 'a screenplay', 'Sergio G.

375,The Impossible,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2732297/,"It would be impossible to try and capture the widespread loss and destruction of this horrible, devastating event. The scope was so large and far too many people lost their lives to even attempt to portray on film. Instead, director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez focused smartly on the true story of one family's struggle for survival amongst all that had happened on December 26th, 2004. This allows the film to be much more intimate, and the audience is quickly able to connect with the Bennett family, starting simply with their arrival to Thailand. While the audience was filled with dread in anticipation of what was to come, the Bennetts were blissfully unaware and enjoying themselves over vacation. However, everything soon takes a terrifying turn as the tsunami hits their resort in a horrifyingly realistic manner, sweeping up people as they attempt to flee before it or protect themselves from its awesome power.At this point, I, too, felt like I was drowning. The camera bobs in and out of darkness, in and out of the water, as the family's matriarch, Maria, struggles for breath. Then, clinging hopelessly onto a palm tree, she screams all too realistically for anyone who could possibly help her in a desperate, surprisingly shocking moment. It is at this point where she spots her son, Lucas, floating in the fierce waves, and I held my breath as the struggled for what seemed like an eternity to reunite in the water.In a way, Lucas, brilliantly portrayed by newcomer Tom Holland, carries the film from this point forward. He takes on the role of protecting his stubborn yet badly injured mother, and in the process he's forced to mature far too quickly. During every moment, his emotions and facial expressions convey more than any words ever could, as she shies away from and is frightened by his mother's injuries and nudity, all the while attempting to deal with the scope of the pain and devastation.However, it is his mother, Maria, whom the film truly centers around. Naomi Watts gives quite possibly her finest performances to date, portraying harrowing desperation, stubborn determination in the face of incredible pain and agony, and, ultimately, a sense of love and care despite her deteriorating state. True, she is bedridden for about half the film, but it is during this time where there are these small moments of tenderness and humility which undoubtedly makes Watts's performance one of the best of the year.In fact, the entire cast was exceptional, including Ewan McGregor, the father desperately trying to put together his family again, and the two littlest sons, Thomas, played by Samuel Joslin, and Simon, played by Oaklee Pendergast, both of whose innocence prevented them from thoroughly capturing the extent of this tragic event. The story of these three is intertwined with that of Maria and Lucas, as they all struggle for survive amidst the destruction and reunite amidst the chaos. Ultimately, this is a touching and heartwarming film, as the true kindness of humanity can be seen in this time of great loss. Yes, the tsunami is terrifying, the injuries gruesome and shockingly realistic, and the pain and suffering visible on just about everyone's faces. However, the Bennetts' story is a remarkable one of love, determination, and hope, and it simply cannot be missed.",positive,"[['the widespread loss', 'destruction', 'devastating event'], ['The scope', 'film'], ['director', 'Juan Antonio Bayona', 'screenwriter', 'Sergio G.

That said, in my personal ranking the Rise of the Planet of the Apes is hands down the worst one of the bunch. There is no real plot, the story is naive to heck and back. It's basically a patchwork of familiar themes which goes like that: Evil (greedy) corporation experiments on apes seeking profit, great noble doctor trying to find cure for Alzheimer to save his father, ape gets smarter, ape gets angry, ape unites the apes, steal serum and makes them smarter, apes beat the (censored) out of the SFPD and find freedom. Oh, and there's this evil ape which you'd think would confront the good ape, but at around 2/3 of the movie producer decides that they should leave room for a sequel (God forbid!) and the last vestiges of a plot wither and die. Oh, did I mention the hot chick which has no role or purpose? Check.The good, some good CGI on the apes (to balance things out the forest scenes are shot on a SDTV cam), and there are a lot of emotional ape cries/ape loves/ape hugs scenes a la 'awww, how cute'. That would appeal to the young female audience I am sure.So to conclude, if you thought the Planet of the Apes was a bad movie (I did), this one hit rock bottom and started digging. i still cannot stomach the current IMDb rating, but hey, vox populi rules the box office.

377,Rise of the Planet of the Apes,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2470315/,"Hollywood is losing ideas. We already know that. Now we are stuck having remakes, reboots, & prequels. And what's worse, most of these prequels are hardly connected to the original film & sometimes they say it's a reboot. The film? It can be entertaining in some parts, but mostly it's a wooden & clichéd sci-fi story. Convoluted from the original Planet of the Apes series but like they say, This could be a reboot. Any new ideas, Hollywood?The movie is totally disconnected from the original Planet of the Apes movies. It's obvious that they wanted to make another reboot of the series. They're losing ideas & wanted to improve some of the old classics. Rise of the Planet of the Apes doesn't want to show the true origin of the first series. I don't think Fox is still capable of making accurate prequels. It's just like X-Men First Class although X-Men is an enjoyable movie and it's necessary to tell its story.The story here can be interesting but it ends up being generic & predictable. Science goes wrong, Humans are evil, Too much sappiness, & ends with a predictable and somewhat exhausting action climax. Since none of the apes are real, The CGI looks impressive though. The main ape's actor, Andy Serkis, only spoken few lines in this movie but the motion he provides to the character is remarkably amazing. He's an expert to these motion capture characters. James Franco ends up being a wooden character. What's the point of Freida Pinto's character? Tom Felton is playing Draco Malfoy again & this time he's teasing Apes. At least John Lithgow gave some emotional moments.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is an altered, predictable, & unnecessary prequel. The filmmaking has already been evolved but still no revolution. The studio is out of ideas & we are getting these unnecessary prequels that suddenly appearing as a reboot. Even the film itself is not good.

378,Celda 211,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2168826/,"Richard Pena, Program Director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, kicked off the Opening Night of the 18th edition of Spanish Cinema Now series at Walter Reade Theater by calling to the stage actors, directors and dignitaries who were in attendance for the New York premiere of Cell 211.Ignasi Guardans Cambo, General Director of the Spanish Film Institute (ICAA) of the Ministry of Culture, compared the Spanish Cinema Now series to an introduction of ""this years harvest."" A fine analogy considering the honest effort, time, sacrifice, teamwork and small miracle in tilling a harvest .The Director of Cell 211, Daniel Monzon, closed out the casual pre-screening ceremony by expressing his warm appreciation for the opportunity to screen in New York City, the setting of King Kong, the movie that inspired his career.Cell 211 opens with a scene of of detailed action. Before any introduction to characters, we meet pain and suffering. A provocative first round.Juan Oliver, played by Alberto Ammann, is starting a job as a prison guard. He decides to show initiative by going to the prison a day early for a lay of the land. He ""kisses"" his beautiful and preganant wife goodbye and heads to work.Be careful of how you make a first impression and who you choose to make it on.Juan's tour of the prison facility takes a turn for the worse and, as Monzon puts it, he is put through ""the worst things a human can go through, in 30 hours.""The action and motivation in Cell 211 hangs on plot and role reversal. In the end the bad man is ""more noble than then guardians of law"" said the director. Monzon was asked during the post-screening Q&A if he hoped the movie would affect change in the Spanish prison system. ""I should be so pretentious.""Portraying elements of the prison experience with truth and honesty was important to the filmmaker. Time was spent with infamous prisoners during the development process, filming took place in a functioning prison and extras were actual prisoners. ""I don't know,"" said the director when asked on how he was given such access. ""Seduction.""Alberto Amman, in his first film acting role, puts in a solid performance. Monzon spoke of a conversation that he had with the novice actor in which Ammann said he felt he was ""cheating"" alongside proved actors like Luis Tosar, who humanizes the portrayal of the violent Malamadre. Monzon directed Ammann to harness that feeling as it fed directly into his character's mode of survival.The entire cast is up to task in Cell 211, including Carlos Bardem, Javier's brother, who plays a slippery jailhouse thug.Check out Cell 211 showing today at Walter Reade as part of Film Society of Lincoln Center's Spanish Now series. Don't fret if you cant get tickets. IFC announced earlier in the day that it will distribute the film through Festival Direct VOD program and the Director ""hopes for some theatrical relaease, too.""The movie is ripe for remake and Richard Pena said as much in his introduction of Cell 211.

380,The Skin I Live In,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2664474/,"Dear lord.... after reading so many glowing reviews of this 'arthouse masterpiece', Pedro Almodóvar's oeuvre was to be honest slightly comical. I was expecting more than a pantomime, a French farce of a film, a Scooby Doo episode with rape scenes, but here it is. it is not shocking, horrific nor psychological, nothing on screen causes the slightest bit of tension due to the lack of character and because of the pretense of the piece to assume that 'I will love it because it's hip', frankly it rather annoyed me. Not a single character makes sense, scenes appear to be crow-barred into place so an extra piece of 10 minute narrative can be made, and most of the film would have been just as affective if it was told by a stranger around a camp-fire.. 'It was on a night like this' indeed... Banderas, whilst doing a great job, just doesn't make sense at all and has half a dozen changes of direction - Is he lonely? Is he evil? Is he a dirty old man? Hmmmm.. Juries out on that one. Still, at least the leading lady yet again catches her death in the name of narrative! And while Elena Anaya is painfully lovely and just about the only consistent role, the story is told with such pantomime it truly is difficult to feel the slightest bit sorry for her.

381,The Skin I Live In,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449616/,"""The Skin I Live In"" is, like most films by the Spanish director a film that cannot be pitched or explained in a few sentences. I am reminded of his superb work in ""Talk to her"" and ""All about my mother"". ""Talk to her"" was a love story between a woman in a coma and her rapist while Mother was a film about a nun with AIDS, a transvestite with a hearth of gold and a woman searching for her son's heart. In one sentence Almodovar's films all sound twisted at best. But in the hands of a master they are beautiful works of art. Same goes for ""The Skin I Live In"". In a sentence (like many who haven't watched the film are quick to point out) the film sounds creepy at best and deals with a plot that makes most uncomfortable.A plastic surgeon (Banderas) belongs to family straight out of Pasolini's Salo. He keeps a beautiful woman (Anaya) as a guinea pig and he tries to create a new kind of skin. But Anaya's character, in what seems the major metaphor of the film, preserves her inner persona intact regardless of what happens to her body. As in most of Almodovar's films the layers become more complex as the movie evolves and towards the end of the film there's a plot twist only Freud could have come up with.Without spoilers I would like to point out that the director seems to use horror as a channel to explore the violation of every moral code embodied by the characters. With a magnificent score by Alberto Iglesias, Almodovar tries for a difficult genre and it pays off. The set design and cinematography, as always with Pedro's films is superb. At Canes the reception of the film was mixed an I can understand why. It simply isn't an easy movie to watch. For those who don't seem to have a problem with American horror movies where teens are stalked, raped and cut into little pieces by a chainsaw but are horrified by ""The Skin I live In"" I have a suggestion: Let's remember that fiction is indeed the only place when one can deal with horror and gore as metaphors for our human flaws, a place where we don't have to hide from our demons but we get to talk to them, a place where sickness gets no one hurt...

385,The Hurt Locker,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2296004/,"Quite easily the best movie of 2009 and the best war movie since Black Hawk Down and maybe even beyond that, The Hurt Locker does something that few other war movies seem to be able to do. Rather than focusing on rapid-action combat scenes and the oh-so-emotional mental breakdowns that all soldiers seem to dramatically endure in Hollywood (Platoon, much?), it emphasizes the relationships of soldiers and the intensity of everyday living in Iraq– intensity that doesn't diminish when the guns are holstered. And that's where you'll see the real difference.The film introduces a seemingly new and unique idea by following a U.S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team as they go around defusing potential bombs all around town– a concept that allows the typical fast-action war theme to take a backseat to the dramatic intensity of the three team members' escapades and arguments. It's all about survival and this time around, it's the calm, isolated atmosphere and the feeling of never being truly safe that creates the ever-present suspense. The exceptional editing is partially to thank for such constant energy and pace. Quick transitions ensure that there is never a dull moment and the audience is always thrust into the middle of the action. Plus, director Kathryn Bigelow employed some amazing cinematography (thanks to Barry Ackroyd, United 93) and some of the best shaky hand-held-cam and zoom work I've seen yet. It seems that, for some, this might be a turn-off, but personally, I believe those who complain about shaky cam need to take a closer look at its purpose and realize that it's far more effective in establishing a documentary-like feel for raw and engaging films such as this one.The interaction between the soldiers is a key point of the film and the entire project is clearly intended to be largely character-driven. You will more than likely find yourself sympathizing with all of the main characters at some point and several others along the way. More than just observing a character's breakdown at the scene of war such as in films like Jarhead, The Hurt Locker immerses the viewer in the world of the characters themselves and practically forces you to care for them– and I mean that in the best way possible. And perhaps the difference is also partially distinguished by the quality of acting. And if there's anyone who deserves recognition for their acting, it's most certainly Jeremy Renner, who surprises with a top-notch performance as Staff Sergeant William James. His performance will have you laughing at bits of humor scattered throughout, gasping in disbelief at one point, shedding a sympathetic tear at another, and yelling at him in exasperation in yet another scene. The characters are never two-dimensional and the film always manages to provide constant reminders that all of the soldiers are just normal people in war situations, driving its purpose home even more effectively. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are impressive in their own roles and share great chemistry both with each other and with Renner. The relationships between the three follow no stereotyped guidelines and their interactions are almost always unpredictable. Further down the billing, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes also give solid performances worth mentioning.Overall, The Hurt Locker is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and packs a visual and cinematographic punch without the over-the-top Hollywood action scenes and special effects.

386,Eastern Promises,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1729470/,"""Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another."" Sir Arthur Conan DoyleIf Viggo Mortensen fighting naked in a London steam bath with some bad Chechens doesn't interest you, then perhaps I can offer you a second-tier Godfather with strong family ""values"" and exceptional acting. Director David Cronenberg in Eastern Promises comes through again with realistic violence and depressing ambiance, cast over by a humanity that even the Godfather has trouble matching.Mid-wife Anna (Naomi Watts) happens on a prostitute's volatile diary in the emergency room. The London Russian mob, vory v zachone, wants it back because it implicates the son of kingpin Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl, Shine) in crimes. Driver to the mob, but good guy deep down, Nikolai (Mortensen), serves as the agent collecting the diary and carrying out the fate of those who have read it. As in most mob stories, loyalty is coin of the realm, so much so that even children of a don are not exempt from the rigid code. As in Dirty Pretty Things, young girls like body parts are bought and sold like slaves in a careless market.Cronenberg's worlds are usually violent, topsy-turvy, and peopled by bipolar miscreants who have accepted the dangers in hope of riches or power but at the same time fight with themselves over the moral implications. So too in Eastern Promises where a helpless newborn topples a kingmaker and makes virtuous royalty of others. Getting the throne or that royalty is tough for Nikolai, whose naked fight to the death in the bath is a tour de force of violent ballet, even discounting Mortensen's other-worldly physique. Cronenberg's fascination with the body's vulnerability is memorable here, stripped down and utterly alone, like birth and death.The majesty of Coppola's Godfather is partly here but more diluted; the array of complex characters in the Corleone family just is not duplicated. Yet Mueller-Stahl has Brando's quiet authority and Mortensen Pacino's quietly dangerous charm (when he says, ""I live in the zone all the time,"" you can't help but wonder what secret turmoil lives in his heart). Neither Eastern Promises actor can possibly surpass those Godfather icons, but they and the film are promising affiliates of the royal gangland canon.",negative,"[['Violence', 'truth', 'recoil', 'the violent', 'the schemer', 'the pit'], ['Sir Arthur Conan DoyleIf Viggo Mortensen', 'London', 'steam', 'bath', 'Chechens', 'interest', 'Godfather', 'strong family', 'exceptional acting'], ['Director David Cronenberg', 'Eastern Promises', 'realistic violence', 'ambiance', 'cast', 'a humanity', 'Godfather', 'trouble', 'Anna', 'Naomi Watts', 'a prostitute', 'volatile diary', 'the emergency', 'room'], ['London Russian', 'mob', 'vory', 'v', 'zachone', 'the son', 'kingpin', 'Semyon', 'Armin Mueller-Stahl', 'Shine'], ['Driver', 'the mob', 'good guy', 'Nikolai', 'Mortensen', 'the agent', 'the fate'], ['mob', 'loyalty', 'coin', 'the realm', 'a don', 'the rigid code'], ['Dirty Pretty Things', 'body', 'a careless market.Cronenberg', 'hope', 'power', 'the same time', 'fight'], ['Eastern Promises', 'a kingmaker', 'virtuous royalty'], ['the throne', 'royalty', 'Nikolai', 'naked fight', 'the death', 'the bath', 'a tour', 'force', 'violent ballet', 'Mortensen', 'other-worldly physique'], ['Cronenberg', 'fascination', 'the body', 'vulnerability', 'birth', 'death.The majesty', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', 'the array', 'Corleone', 'family'], ['Mueller-Stahl', 'Brando', 'quiet authority', 'Mortensen Pacino', 'dangerous charm', 'the zone', 'the time', 'secret turmoil', 'heart'], ['Promises', 'actor', 'Godfather', 'the film', 'the royal', 'gangland', 'canon']]","[['Violence', 'truth', 'recoil', 'violent', 'schemer', 'pit'], ['Sir Arthur Conan DoyleIf Viggo Mortensen', 'London steam bath', 'bad Chechens', 'interest', 'second-tier Godfather', 'strong family', 'values', 'exceptional acting'], ['Director David Cronenberg', 'Eastern Promises', 'realistic violence', 'ambiance', 'cast', 'humanity', 'Godfather', 'trouble', 'matching.Mid-wife Anna', 'Naomi Watts', 'prostitute', 'volatile diary', 'emergency room'], ['London Russian mob', 'vory v zachone', 'son of kingpin Semyon', 'Armin Mueller-Stahl', 'Shine', 'crimes'], ['Driver', 'mob', 'good guy', 'Nikolai', 'Mortensen', 'agent', 'fate'], ['mob stories', 'loyalty', 'coin', 'realm', 'children', 'don', 'rigid code'], ['Dirty Pretty Things', 'girls like body parts', 'slaves', 'careless market.Cronenberg', 'worlds', 'bipolar miscreants', 'dangers in hope', 'riches or power', 'time fight', 'moral implications'], ['Eastern Promises', 'helpless newborn topples', 'kingmaker', 'royalty of others'], ['throne', 'royalty', 'Nikolai', 'naked fight', 'death', 'bath', 'tour de force', 'violent ballet', 'Mortensen', 'other-worldly physique'], ['Cronenberg', 'fascination', 'body', 'vulnerability', 'birth', 'majesty of Coppola', 'Godfather', 'array', 'complex characters', 'Corleone family'], ['Mueller-Stahl', 'Brando', 'quiet authority', 'Mortensen Pacino', 'dangerous charm', 'zone', 'time', 'turmoil lives', 'heart'], ['Promises actor', 'Godfather icons', 'film', 'affiliates', 'royal gangland canon']]"
387,Eastern Promises,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1730427/,"First of all it is amazing the amount of research that went into this movie. When Mortissen's characters says that his father worked for the government, in Russian he actually says: ""Hunched his back for the uncle""! Even the poster with little and index finger straighter then the rest, it all breathers authenticity.I didn't go in expecting non-Russian actors to suddenly have no accent, but I did have hesitations about the pronunciation, that usually tends to be horrible. Not so here, despite the accent (that was slight), the intonation, the way the characters cary themselves especially Mortinssen's are very Russian. (Even his less then perfect English sounds Russia when he misses articles: ""Not good place for girl to grow up."") Overall the director shows a bit of what a real SinCity looks like. Violence is like a snap of a whip, sudden and loud. The movie is very stylish, but without trying to be so. It's just how these people like to live their lifes. A lot has been said about acting and it is true Mortinssen really delivers. All the auther actors are great too though, there is no weak link in this movie.Anyway the bottom line: The most authentic movie about Russian mobsters that the west has produced so far.

388,Inside Man,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136664/,"This review is full of SPOILERS and is meant for those who've seen this film. 1. Major plot flaw. The police would have identified the ""painters"" almost immediately, and this is hidden from the audience by the way in which the interrogation scenes are handled. The criminals' strategy for escape was to blend in with the other hostages and be unidentifiable. The video surveillance cameras were disabled only 2 minutes before the ""painters"" entered. By checking the videos the police would see what customers had entered the bank before then and could rule them out as ""painters."" The police could also rule-out all employees, not only because employees would be on tape, but even if not, the employees would know who of their number was in the bank at the time they were seized. This means that the ""painters"" could only be customers, and could only be among those customers who walked in during the two minutes between disabling the cameras and the entry of the ""painters."" Look at the number of customers already in the bank before the cameras went out -- a lot. Not many came in during those 2 minutes, even if some left during those 2 minutes. At most, let's say that 12 people came in during those 2 minutes, including the ""painters."" Then get physical descriptions of the ""painters'"" height, weight, sex, etc., from all the hostages. Compare those with the physical details of the 12 people. Of the 12 people, how many match each description? If one, the police have spotted a ""painter"" already. If 2 or 3 or 4, the police have a very small number of people to investigate further to expose which of that small group is a ""painter."" Moreover, every customer has to have a reason for being there: either to deal with an existing account, or open a new one. But a person opening a new account would go to an employee to start the process. So the ""painters"" each had to have already established an individual account with that bank. When did those 12 people open their accounts? The police would look at the time each of the 12 first opened an account. More recent accounts, opened at about the same date, would indicate who the ""painters"" might be. Now, why were each of the 12 at that downtown branch at that time, as opposed to a different branch or a different time? It must be, either they work nearby, or live nearby, or are running an errand where the route includes that branch. What friend or relative saw them in person before they left to go to the branch? How did they get to the branch -- walking, or subway, or taxi? How were they planning to get to their next destination? Where did they plan to go after their errand at the branch was finished? Who was expecting to see them at that place? Did anyone who was expecting to see them later that day wonder what had happened to them, or call the police to ask whether they were among the hostages? Recently opened accounts, near the date of other accounts, by people who neither live nor work near that branch, or have a plausible errand, who can't tell a plausible tale of how they got there or where they planned to go next, or who was expecting them: these are the prime suspects for ""painters."" The police very swiftly will have a very good idea who the ""painters"" are. Investigate them in detail and they are exposed; then pressure them to reveal the identities of the other criminals. This is what real police would do, but the movie, by showing the police pursuing a different, useless approach, leads the audience to think the ""painter"" masquerade would work. This movie operates on the old principle ""the criminal plot looks brilliant because the police are made to act like idiots yet look intelligent."" 2. Major moral blindness. 50 innocent citizens are terrorized, held hostage, assaulted, battered, for a day, a very significant crime, and yet at the end we are told that because nothing was stolen from the bank, the government and the police are just going to drop the whole affair. But what the criminals did to those people was a far more serious crime than any theft of bank property would have been. This movie passes-off that crime as if it were nothing, nothing at all. The terrorized hostages are pushed off the stage like so many plastic dolls who've served their role in the filmmakers' story. But those characters are human beings. The criminals, supposedly motivated by an idealistic desire to act against a Nazi profiteer, commit a horrific moral injustice on innocent people, whose rights and dignity they are blind to, in the pursuit of their own moral mission. This is a profound moral flaw in this film. The criminals are narcissists, so focused on their own desire for justice in their cause that they are blind to the injustice they inflict on others as they pursue their mission. 3. Unbelievable characters. A billionaire bank president anguished over his past exploitation of the Holocaust, but who is trying to hide his past, by hiring a real estate agent who has a side-line as a high-level ""fixer"" of rich people's problems, who is herself disgusted by his pro-Nazi past, yet takes his pay-off check anyway, and whose only attempt to ""fix"" the problem is a short and ineffective conversation with the criminal master-mind? A supposedly smart and honorable police hostage negotiator who is also the chief interrogator of the suspects, and who takes a diamond pay-off from the mastermind with a laugh, and who is completely blind to the serious crime of terrorism and hostage-taking of 50 civilians? None of these characters is believable.",negative,"[['This review', 'SPOILERS', 'this film'], [], ['Major plot', 'flaw'], ['The police', 'the audience', 'the way', 'the interrogation'], ['strategy',

I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break.

I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life.

396,Match Point,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1232243/,"Well. And what a waste of 8 euros ""Match Point"" turned out to be. As it happens, Woody Allen couldn't get financing in the US, or at least without strings attached, so he's decided to go and milk the BBC instead. Which means, in effect, that he recycled a story he'd written for a New York setting straight into a London setting, without any attempt at any significant rewrite. And ""written"" is a loose term. ""An American Tragedy"" meets ""A Place In The Sun"" meets ""Room at the Top"" meets ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" meets (but let's not get carried away) ""Le Rouge et le Noir."" Ambitious poor boy courts aristocratic rich girl then gets torn between rich in-laws and poor girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks. If you think this is too generic a summary, that's the whole point: ""Match Point"" is nothing but generic.It's not just that Jonathan Rhys Meyers' young Irish tennis pro speaks like a 1950s BBC presenter without a hint of an explanation of how it came to him; it's that when he meets an old tennis acquaintance in the street, or when he bursts into a rage, his accent doesn't change. (Everybody in the movie speaks RP, except for the Scot-and-Cockney-coppers-as-comic-relief, and the property agent right at the beginning, probably because he was initially written as yammering in broad Brooklynese.) It's not just that sugar-daddy's country house is totally unconvincing if he's old money (wall-to-wall carpeting?), or his accent is if he's Alan Sugar. It's not just that somehow, I can't imagine a London copper calling someone a ""schmuck"", or a Sloane Ranger, however arty, mention that a couple is made in heaven because ""their neuroses match"". Or another Sloane boasting of getting good invitations because she was ""born in Belgravia."" Or that the country house set would welcome their daughter marrying a tennis instructor. Or that the cocktail-swilling son of the house, all public-school accent and Jeeves-and-Woosterish quips, could get away with calling even the hired help ""Hey, Irish"", meaning it to be affectionate. (Although the initial meeting between said son, played on automatic pilot by Matthew Goode, and JRM as his tennis coach at the Kensington Queen's Club, plays like nothing more than a gay pickup, all ""Oh, you like opera? My father gives a tonne of money to Covent Garden, can I take you to Traviata tomorrow night?"" for entirely too long for his sister to look like anything but a beard for the rest of the movie.) Or that even Richard Branson could just snap his fingers and said tennis pro becomes magically a business wizard. Or that a would-be American actress with only a commercial under her belt would audition for a part at the Royal Court.It's that nobody has a real backstory, or even edges. (Scarlett Johansson does wonders with what little she's given. JRM is pretty - when he panics, you can't quite tell whether it's because he's afraid of handling a gun, or because he's just read the rest of the screenplay.) As for London, Allen tries for the postcard effect he perfected in ""Manhattan"" (complete with self-reference to the River Café shot), but he entirely misses the texture of the city: there isn't a single London scene set in a house, for instance, it's all flats (it's summer but Allen's London practically has no trees); people shop in Mayfair (at Aspreys and Ralph Lauren, natch), not Sloane Street; and when JRM, early in the movie, takes his posh totty for a romantic walk, it's to watch the changing of the guard at Buck House.To be honest, there is a lovely plot twist right in the last five minutes. It's contrived, yes, but very clever. But it's not worth waiting two hours for.And apparently, the Beeb has done it again: Allen's next movie, also starring Johansson, is also set in London. Chaps, this is your licence fee money that's being wasted.It probably won't surprise anyone that the same French critics who found Existentialist genius in Jerry Lewis simply loved the movie, ranking it as high as Annie Hall in Allen's oeuvre. Le Monde called in ""pungent social criticism with...a deeply-felt clinical study of class relations conditioning men's [*] behaviour and destiny in the...deterministic social system."" And you were wondering why we had those riots.[*] Nah, this isn't a feminist take - Le Monde's critics have no qualms about using ""men"" when they mean ""human.""",negative,"[[], ['a waste', 'Match',

397,Match Point,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1264775/,"Would it that this film had been made in the Forties or Fifties when film-noir was at its high point! Woody Allen, one of America's best directors pays his homage to the genre in his latest film about romantic obsession, and if his name weren't in the opening credits you wouldn't know he directed it. Taking a break from filming in the city he loves the most, deleting every trace of the well known neurotic hoots and clicks from his main and supporting British cast, and even removing the trademark reference to his own persona from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performance, MATCH POINT becomes a very European film that starts out deceptively as a character study with comedic tones and ever so subtle moves into the darker side of love, echoing THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and of all films, FATAL ATTRACTION.A love quadrangle, the oldest plot device, is Allen's focus this time: Chris Wilton (Rhys-Meyers), a retired tennis player, becomes an instructor to Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Both find that they have similar interests, such as the love of opera and the works of Dostoyevsky. (They have another similar interest, but I'm getting there). Tom invites Chris for an evening at the opera and introduces him to his family and sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who falls for him and who later on signifies familial safety in all forms. Sensing an opportunity to climb the social ladder he starts seeing her just as he meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johanssen), an aspiring American actress, whom he openly flirts with until he realizes she's Tom's girlfriend, but an outsider in the Wilton household. A clandestine affair between Chris and Nola begins tentative at first -- she advises him against it since it would ruin his chances to become a success and she is engaged to Tom -- but turns deeper. However, a turn of events transpire, taking Nola out of the picture, having Tom marry another girl and Chris marry Chloe, and start to get complicated once Chris tracks Nola down.Like I said, would it that MATCH POINT would have been filmed 60 years ago because everything in it smolders like the plot elements of the sleekest of noir films. With a deliberate pace that begins taking a sinister shape after the second half, Allen misdirects the audience to the very core. Allen avoids any trace of romantic melodrama, though, and in showing what actually transpires between a couple ensnared in an affair -- their initial bedazzlement, their passion consummated, turning into routine and then its painful decline -- is true to life. Nola, initially seen in white much like Lana Turner in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE seems to be in total control until Allen deftly pulls the rug out of her feet and has her do a slow collapse into her own trap, dressed in darker and darker colors. Chris, at first, so lusts after her it's a question if he can choose her love over social status and this becomes the crux of MATCH POINT: whether the tennis ball falls over the net or not.There are moments when you think that a director who once had his audience eating out of his hand has gone into autopilot or entered a point of no return. Up until recently, Woody Allen had had even his most hardcore fans put through the ringer with film after film of a disposable nature. With this film, which has a strong connection to CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, he shows that he never was gone. In erasing all references to his staccatto style, he wins over a new audience willing to accept his work with ease and this is at times necessary: like Hitchcock's self-effacing FRENZY, MATCH POINT is an excellent movie showcasing a director in full control of his ability to tell a visual tale. Maybe not up there with the best of his roster but pretty damn close, and that's saying quite a wallop.",positive,"[['this film', 'film-noir', 'high point'], ['Woody', 'Allen', 'America', 'homage', 'the genre', 'film', 'romantic obsession', 'name', 'the opening'], ['a break', 'the city', 'every trace', 'the well', 'British cast', 'the trademark', 'reference', 'own persona', 'Jonathan Rhys-Meyers', 'performance', 'MATCH POINT', 'European film', 'a character', 'study', 'the darker', 'side', 'love', 'THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE', 'FATAL ATTRACTION.A', 'quadrangle', 'plot', 'device', 'Allen', 'focus', 'this time', 'Chris Wilton', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'a retired tennis', 'player', 'an instructor', 'Tom Hewett', 'Matthew Goode'], ['the love', 'opera', 'Dostoyevsky'], ['another similar interest'], ['Tom', 'Chris', 'an evening', 'the opera', 'family', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Emily Mortimer', 'familial safety'], ['an opportunity', 'the social ladder', 'Nola Rice', 'Scarlett Johanssen', 'an aspiring American actress', 'Tom', 'girlfriend', 'an outsider', 'Wilton', 'household'], ['A clandestine', 'affair', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'a success', 'Tom'], ['a turn', 'transpire', 'Nola', 'the picture', 'Tom', 'marry', 'another girl', 'Chris marry Chloe', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'down.Like', 'MATCH POINT', 'everything', 'the plot'], ['a deliberate pace', 'a sinister', 'shape', 'the second half', 'Allen', 'the audience', 'core'], ['Allen', 'any trace', 'romantic melodrama', 'a couple', 'an affair', 'initial bedazzlement', 'passion', 'painful decline', 'life'], ['Nola', 'Lana Turner', 'THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE', 'total control', 'Allen', 'the rug', 'collapse', 'own trap', 'darker', 'darker'], ['Chris', 'a question', 'love', 'social status', 'the crux', 'MATCH POINT', 'the tennis', 'ball', 'a director', 'audience', 'hand', 'autopilot', 'a point', 'no return'], ['Woody Allen', 'the ringer', 'film', 'film', 'a disposable nature'], ['this film', 'a strong connection', 'CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS'], ['staccatto', 'style', 'a new audience', 'work', 'ease', 'Hitchcock', 'self-effacing', 'FRENZY', 'MATCH POINT', 'an excellent movie', 'a director', 'full control', 'ability', 'a visual tale'], ['roster', 'a wallop']]","[['film', 'Forties or Fifties', 'film-noir', 'high point'], ['Woody Allen', 'America', 'directors', 'homage', 'genre', 'film', 'romantic obsession', 'name', 'opening credits'], ['break', 'city', 'trace', 'well', 'neurotic hoots and clicks', 'British cast', 'trademark reference', 'persona from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers', 'performance', 'MATCH POINT', 'European film', 'character study', 'comedic tones', 'subtle moves', 'darker side', 'love', 'THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE', 'films', 'FATAL ATTRACTION.A', 'quadrangle', 'plot device', 'Allen', 'focus', 'time', 'Chris Wilton', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'tennis player', 'instructor', 'Tom Hewett', 'Matthew Goode'], ['similar interests', 'love of opera', 'works of Dostoyevsky'], ['similar interest'], ['Tom', 'Chris', 'evening', 'opera', 'family', 'sister Chloe', 'Emily Mortimer', 'signifies', 'familial safety', 'forms'], ['opportunity', 'social ladder', 'Nola Rice', 'Scarlett Johanssen', 'aspiring American actress', 'Tom', 'girlfriend', 'outsider', 'Wilton household'], ['clandestine affair', 'Chris and Nola', 'chances', 'success', 'Tom'], ['turn of events transpire', 'Nola', 'picture', 'Tom marry', 'girl', 'Chris marry Chloe', 'Chris tracks Nola down.Like', 'MATCH POINT', 'years', 'everything', 'plot elements', 'noir films'], ['deliberate pace', 'sinister shape', 'second half', 'Allen', 'audience', 'core'], ['Allen', 'trace', 'romantic melodrama', 'couple', 'affair', 'initial bedazzlement', 'passion', 'painful decline', 'life'], ['Nola', 'Lana Turner', 'THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE', 'control until Allen', 'rug', 'feet', 'collapse', 'own trap', 'darker', 'darker colors'], ['Chris', 'question', 'love', 'social status', 'crux of MATCH POINT', 'tennis ball', 'moments', 'director', 'audience', 'hand', 'autopilot', 'point', 'return'], ['Woody Allen', 'hardcore fans', 'ringer with film', 'film', 'disposable nature'], ['film', 'strong connection', 'CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS'], ['references', 'staccatto style', 'new audience', 'work with ease', 'times', 'Hitchcock', 'self-effacing FRENZY', 'MATCH POINT', 'excellent movie', 'director', 'full control', 'ability', 'visual tale'], ['roster', 'wallop']]"
398,Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0859504/,"There are two reasons to watch Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.  The violence and the sound.  Or rather, the sound and the violence.The main character's lack of one sense drives the film, both form and function wise.  Occasionally, we lose one of the two ways in which we interact with the film (sound, sight).  The loss of one sense adds value to the other.  It makes the normally assumed other seem all the more there. Unlike most Hollywood takes on this particular sense absence, we get a bit of a glimpse into what the absence means to the character, and not just what it means to us looking at the character as third person.  What results are some very nice moments that are film using itself as a medium to one of its potentials.This movie is well titled (english translation), but why won't become obvious until the last third of the film.    The violence is a bit overwhelming, especially given the tone of the initial third.  We start off thinking that maybe all planned actions will go as they should, without harm, and without significant consequence, that implied violence might only exist beyond the threshold of common sense.  As plans slowly unravel, and as tragedy exerts its sometimes tender hold, we see an escalation of blood with few limits in depiction.Mr. Park (and here I'm paraphrasing a translator's take) has stated that the violence in this film is less bloody, and less realistic (?) than that found in horror movies, or movies of other persuasion (action?). What he says is true, but in those movies we are distanced from the events via a somewhat thick veil of disbelief.  Unlikely characters and unlikely events combine for a combustion that makes it easy for to be distant from the gore.

399,Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0859510/,"Vengeance is one of humanity's more lamentable instincts, and one we'll have to overcome as a species one day. When one acts out of vengeance one seeks only to hurt, and when people start hurting each other because they're hurt themselves, everybody ends up hurting and nobody really gains anything.I think that's the main message Park Chan-Wook wants us to take away from SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, though the movie is complex and oblique and doubtless open to many interpretations. It is a challenging movie in many ways - the story is never spelled out clearly, leaving the viewer to deduce many key events and motivations. Dialogue is sparse, and this is not solely attributable to the fact that the main character is deaf and dumb. The movie also challenges - almost terrorises - with its bleakness and occasional scenes of quite disturbing violence and gore.SFMV is an ambitious project, and one that doesn't fit into any established cinematic mould. The story, characters, themes and aesthetics are all very unusual and creative. I can't think of any other film that's quite like it, though at times I likened the experience to that of watching certain Takashi Miike movies. Actually, Kim Ki-Duk's movies are probably the closest point of reference, though Park Chan-Wook's film is smarter.SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is not a movie I'd choose for a movie night with friends, or one that I'd lend or recommend to most of the people I know. Perhaps I'm unfair in my assessment of my friends, but I can't think of many that would enjoy it. Actually I'm surprised that the film is held in such wide regard, as its not a conventional film or an easy film, and is far more art than entertainment. In my experience that narrows a film's audience significantly, but I've yet to hear anybody express a negative reaction to the film. I guess originality and technical virtuosity are still appreciated after all - perhaps more so by those that have gravitated to Korean cinema in recent years than in other groups, since they are most often to be found there.With JSA and SFMV, Park Chan-Wook has definitely shown himself to be one of the brightest figures in the new wave of Korean directors. Both are very well crafted in pretty much every respect. The cast of SFMV also deserve commendation for their performances, which are all good. Song Kang-Ho steals the show with a wonderfully understated performance, though.Recommended, but make sure you know what you're getting.",positive,"[['Vengeance', 'humanity', 'day'], ['vengeance', 'everybody', 'nobody', 'the main message', 'Park Chan-Wook', 'SYMPATHY FOR MR.

402,The Butterfly Effect,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1203239/,"If we want to analyze where this movie fails, we can look no further than the title. It alludes to a popular metaphor in chaos theory, the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could cause a storm on the other side of the world. It also draws heavily on Ray Bradbury's classic short story in which the entire history of mankind is affected by someone stepping on an insect.Based on this background, you'd think this movie would be about how tiny, trivial events can have monumental, unpredictable consequences. I would have liked to see a film that truly addresses this possibility, since most time-travel movies ignore it. In ""Back to the Future,"" for example, I could never believe that Marty would ever be able to set the past straight after his initial interference. Just his setting foot in the 1950s ought to have threatened his existence. Why? It's quite simple. Even though his parents will get married to each other, how can he be sure they'll have the same kids? ""Back to the Future"" set the standard for the genre by narrowing the scope of possible changes when dealing with time paradoxes.The main problem with ""The Butterfly Effect"" is that it doesn't transcend this level but simply thinks that it does. Take the scene where Kutcher tries to stop the exploding mailbox. The chain reaction of events that result from this act may be drastic, but there is nothing unpredictable about it. He affects a crucial event in his life and the result is a straightforward, logical consequence, hardly akin to stepping on an insect and changing the course of man. The writers could have used far more imagination when devising the plot. Other changes that the character makes are unconvincing, such as the notion that he could prevent recurrent child abuse simply by threatening someone on a single occasion. That scene, in any case, is not a good example of little things affecting the world in big ways. It's an example of wishful thinking, plain and simple. When the scenario finally goes wrong, it happens because of the way Kutcher's character acts in the altered present, not because of the altered time-line itself.The film's first forty-five minutes are somewhat more promising. These early scenes deal with Kutcher's childhood experiences, how he blacks out whenever his life becomes too traumatic. It's an intriguing setup that would have left me wondering where the story was headed had I not already seen the trailer, where I learned that it was going to be about time travel. On a dramatic level, the movie's biggest failing is that it never follows through with the tone it sets up in the beginning. We're promised a thriller, but the movie degenerates into what can best be described as an episodic black comedy, almost a dark version of ""Bedazzled.""This is sort of entertaining, but I was hoping for more. I may have been influenced by the fact that shortly before seeing the film, I read ""Bid Time Return,"" the Richard Matheson novel on which the 1980 movie ""Somewhere in Time"" is based. This book, even more than the movie adaptation, strongly leads us to suspect that the time-traveling experience occurs only in the protagonist's mind. ""The Butterfly Effect"" has a similar ambiguity that it never truly addresses, perhaps because mainstream audiences would have found such an approach too disturbing.You may notice that I have so far not talked about the acting, and I will resist the temptation to rag on Kutcher's performance more than others have done. He's not terribly engaging, but it's not all his fault (especially considering that his character is played by other actors for a good portion of the film). The real problem lies at the level of the script, which doesn't give Kutcher much to do. The film is so plot-driven it doesn't spend much time on its characters.Ultimately, this movie has nothing new to contribute to the time travel genre. While it tries to pass itself off as a twist on the old premise, it quickly becomes a fairly routine thriller about a man tweaking his past. I hope that the next time they decide to do such a film, they'll leave cool metaphors like butterfly effects to a script that is truly willing to deal with such concepts instead of simply pretending to.",negative,"[['this movie', 'the title'], ['a popular metaphor', 'chaos', 'theory', 'the idea', 'a butterfly', 'a storm', 'the other side', 'the world'], ['Ray Bradbury', 'classic short story', 'the entire history', 'mankind', 'someone', 'this background', 'this movie'], ['a film', 'this possibility'], ['Back', 'the Future', 'example', 'Marty', 'the past straight', 'initial interference'], ['foot', 'existence'], [], [], [], ['the Future', 'the standard', 'the genre', 'the scope', 'time', 'paradoxes.The', 'main problem', 'Butterfly Effect', 'this level'], ['the scene', 'Kutcher', 'the exploding', 'mailbox'], ['The chain', 'reaction', 'this act', 'nothing'], ['a crucial event', 'life', 'the result', 'a straightforward', 'logical consequence', 'an insect', 'the course', 'man'], ['imagination', 'the plot'], ['the character', 'the notion', 'recurrent child', 'abuse', 'someone', 'a single occasion'], ['That scene', 'any case', 'a good example', 'the world'], ['an example', 'wishful thinking', 'plain', 'simple'], ['the scenario', 'the way', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'the altered present', 'the altered time-line itself.The', 'film', 'promising'], ['deal', 'Kutcher', 'childhood', 'life'], ['an intriguing setup', 'the story', 'the trailer', 'time', 'travel'], ['a dramatic level', 'the movie', 'failing', 'the tone', 'the beginning'], ['a thriller', 'the movie', 'an episodic black comedy', 'a dark version', 'Bedazzled'], ['sort', 'entertaining'], ['the fact', 'the film', 'Bid Time Return', 'Richard Matheson', 'novel', 'movie', 'Time'], ['This book', 'the movie', 'adaptation', 'the time-traveling experience', 'the protagonist', 'mind'], ['Butterfly Effect', 'a similar ambiguity', 'an approach', 'the acting', 'the temptation', 'Kutcher', 'performance'], ['fault', 'character', 'a good portion', 'the film'], ['The real problem', 'the level', 'the script'], ['The film', 'much time', 'this movie', 'nothing', 'the time', 'travel', 'genre'], ['a twist', 'the old premise', 'routine thriller', 'a man', 'past'], ['the next time', 'a film', 'butterfly', 'a script']]","[['movie', 'title'], ['metaphor in chaos theory', 'idea', 'butterfly', 'wings', 'storm', 'other side', 'world'], ['Ray Bradbury', 'classic short story', 'history of mankind', 'someone', 'background', 'movie', 'trivial events', 'unpredictable consequences'], ['film', 'possibility', 'time-travel movies'], ['Back', 'Future', 'example', 'Marty', 'past straight', 'initial interference'], ['foot', 'existence'], [], [], ['parents', 'same kids'], ['Future', 'standard', 'genre', 'scope', 'possible changes', 'time paradoxes.The', 'main problem', 'Butterfly Effect', 'level'], ['scene', 'Kutcher', 'exploding mailbox'], ['chain reaction', 'events', 'act', 'nothing'], ['crucial event', 'life', 'result', 'straightforward', 'logical consequence', 'insect', 'course of man'], ['writers', 'imagination', 'plot'], ['Other changes', 'character', 'notion', 'child abuse', 'someone', 'single occasion'], ['scene', 'case', 'good example', 'little things', 'world', 'big ways'], ['example', 'wishful thinking', 'plain and simple'], ['scenario', 'way Kutcher', 'character', 'altered present', 'itself.The film', 'first forty-five minutes', 'promising'], ['scenes deal', 'Kutcher', 'childhood experiences', 'life'], ['intriguing setup', 'story', 'trailer', 'time travel'], ['dramatic level', 'movie', 'failing', 'tone', 'beginning'], ['thriller', 'movie', 'episodic black comedy', 'dark version', 'Bedazzled'], ['sort of entertaining'], ['fact', 'film', 'Bid Time Return', 'Richard Matheson novel', 'movie', 'Time'], ['book', 'movie adaptation', 'time-traveling experience', 'protagonist', 'mind'], ['Butterfly Effect', 'similar ambiguity', 'addresses', 'mainstream audiences', 'approach', 'acting', 'temptation', 'Kutcher', 'performance', 'others'], ['fault', 'character', 'other actors', 'good portion', 'film'], ['real problem', 'level', 'script'], ['film', 'much time', 'movie', 'nothing', 'time travel genre'], ['twist', 'old premise', 'routine thriller', 'man', 'past'], ['next time', 'film', 'metaphors like butterfly effects', 'script', 'such concepts']]"
403,The Butterfly Effect,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1701893/,"What if you could go back to major junctions in your life and take the other path? What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can't achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?A great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher  but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20's without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we've since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.What truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980's, grew up in the 1990's, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980's technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.Above all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor  a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes duration, all I can do is humbly bow down in front of its makers' talents.

A small group of survivors manages to stay alive and uninfected, but not for long. Eventually, they one-by-one fall victim to the awful disease and the remaining survivors have sealed a pact that involves them instantly killing any member of their group that has become infected, not to endanger those who are still alive and not yet zombies. As the survivors count their time left, they attempt to make it to a British military base near Manchester where they believe they will be safe. They do eventually make it there, but what can stop zombies (who are mindless, blood-thirsty and have nothing to lose) from invading an army base? Are the survivors and British soldiers safe?

407,Battle Royale,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0772133/,"Battle Royale is based on the shockwave novel by Koushun Takami, which is a bestseller in Japan, and which has become very controversial in a very short time (and it is really easy to understand why). The plot is relatively simple (a class of junior high school students are forced to kill each other on a desert island, the last survivor wins and can go back home), but it is this simplicity that makes its strength. No need for a very long prologue before we enter the main act. Each of the 42 pupils involved in this ""game"" are not volunteers (no one would be..,), and of course they are forced to kill their best friends /girlfriends in order to survive this horror. The personalities and characteristics of each of the participants are of course very contrasted and even if there are some cliches, well, the worst has been avoided. There are even quite ""realistic"" (even if it is very difficult to judge what can be realistic with such a plot) moments. The transcription of the inner thoughts of the characters, which is one of the strengths of the book, is averagely well retranscripted. Takeshi Kitano plays a ""teacher"" (whose name is ...Kitano), leading the operation of surveilliance of this ""game"". It is very difficult to give an objective comment on this movie. Violent. Ultra-Violent. And bloody. This is for sure. The book has to be read for a more complete description of the hesitations and fears, but the movie restranscripts very well the book is the sense that it is all ""absurd"". There is no real meaning to this violence. The students know this, but it can not be avoided.  It is quite sad that the movie dropped an essential background element of the book (the story in the book takes place in an imaginery Japan which would have not lost WWII, and the movie takes place in a slightly modified modern Japan), but I guess that making this happen in the ""real-world"" shows that there is no need to go to an imaginary world to see to what extreme behaviors humans are capable of.Highly disturbing.

408,The Others,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0958625/,"Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.With 'The Others', Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool, haughty façade, the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent. 'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal, and it is worth every minute. 7/10Shelly",negative,"[['a scary film'], ['Others', 'Alejandro Amenabar', 'Abre los Ojos', 'fun film', 'the genre'], ['the island', 'Jersey', 'England', 'Grace', 'Nicole Kidman', 'the mother', 'Charles', 'Christopher Eccleston', 'Anne', 'Alakina Mann', 'the sunlight'], ['any room', 'a cumbersome task', 'mansion'], ['the mansion', 'staff', 'the week', 'the arrival', 'a gardener'], ['the fact', 'Anne', 'an unseen child', 'Grace', 'lives.With', 'Others', 'Amenabar', 'a truly', 'spooky', 'stylish thriller'], ['The foggy', 'the mansion', 'the dark', 'the house', 'the film'], ['Kidman', 'the incredibly', 'brittle', 'Grace'], ['a cool', 'haughty', 'façade', 'sanity'], ['Alakina Mann', 'Kidman'], ['The screenplay', 'Amenabar', ""the 'twist"", 'the end'], ['well-written regardless', 'the impact', 'discovery', 'pretty decent'], ['a phenomenal film', 'change', 'the standard thriller/suspense', 'fare', 'a truly intelligent', 'stylish bent', 'the genre'], ['this film', 'much anyone', 'jump-cut fest'], ['time', 'reveal', 'every minute'], []]","[['scary film'], ['Others', 'Alejandro Amenabar', 'Abre los Ojos', 'fun film', 'genre'], ['island of Jersey', 'England', 'Grace', 'Nicole Kidman', 'mother', 'small children', 'Charles', 'Christopher Eccleston', 'Anne', 'Alakina Mann', 'sunlight'], ['room', 'curtains', 'cumbersome task', 'mansion', 'doors'], ['mansion', 'staff', 'week', 'arrival', 'new servants', 'gardener', 'housekeepers'], ['matters', 'fact that Anne', 'unseen child', 'unexplained footsteps', 'curtains and doors', 'uber-fragile Grace', 'occurrences', 'lives.With', 'Others', 'Amenabar', 'truly spooky', 'stylish thriller'], ['foggy', 'mansion', 'dark rooms', 'candles', 'house', 'beautiful stylistic areas', 'film'], ['Kidman', 'incredibly brittle', 'frayed Grace'], ['cool', 'haughty façade', 'circumstances', 'sanity'], ['actors', 'children', 'Alakina Mann', 'scenes with Kidman', 'others'], ['screenplay', 'Amenabar', ""'twist"", 'end'], ['well-written regardless', 'impact upon discovery', 'pretty decent'], ['Others', 'phenomenal film', 'means', 'change', 'thriller/suspense fare', 'truly intelligent', 'stylish bent', 'genre'], ['children', 'film', 'much anyone', 'jump-cut fest', 'prevalent nowadays'], ['Others', 'time', 'reveal', 'minute'], []]"

411,Traffic,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0616144/,"Early in the year 2000, director Steven Soderbergh's film, Erin Brokovich, sizzled at the box office  (bringing in over $130 million) while receiving critical acclaim.  Now, with the release of his latest film, Traffic, Soderbergh stands to earn Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for both of these movies.  It's no wonder, either, as Traffic is one of the most gripping films to hit theatres in 2000.Traffic takes on the complex issues involved with the war on drugs in the United States and Mexico from the view of these nations as a whole to the very personal level.  In the film, three  stories unfold to illustrate the near impossibility of ever stopping the drug trade, despite the billion dollars that the US spends each year for just that cause.  While the tales are related, the characters rarely, if ever, cross paths with one another. This is one of the elements that allows Soderbergh to deliver his message so effectively.The first story features Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.  A cop in Baja, Mexico, he enforces the law and allows the wheels to be greased from time to time.  After pulling off a huge drug bust on the Juarez drug cartel, the powerful General Salazar swoops in to confiscate all of the drugs and the credit.  Later, Javier and his partner are recruited by Salazar to fight the war on drugs by aiding him in bringing down the Obregon cartel that has plagued Tijuana for some time.Meanwhile, back in the States, Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) of the Ohio Supreme Court is about to be appointed by the President as the nation's new leader in the drug war. For the judge, the drug war is about to become more personal than he could ever have imagined.In San Diego, Monty (Don Cheadle) and Ray (Luis Guzman) are two federal agents perpetrating a drug bust on a slimy drug supplier named Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer).  The events that follow lead them up the drug food chain to Carlos Ayala, a well-to-do suburban man who has been smuggling illegal drugs into the country from Mexico.   His arrest leaves his pregnant wife, Helena (Katherine Zeta-Jones, who was really pregnant during the film), to fend for herself while taking care of their son, court costs, and a $3 million dollar debt to the drug lords in Mexico.Traffic, written by Simon Moore (the writer for the British miniseries, Traffik, upon which this script is based), is superbly crafted and woven. We learn just enough about each character to give us some insight into their motives for the courses they choose to follow.  By the films end, matters are not neatly wrapped up; there is not a fairy tale ending.  This simply adds to the realism of the issues presented within the movie.  Furthermore, the intertwining stories drive home the fact that drugs are closer to you than you think.The script is bolstered by the phenomenal, ensemble cast.  Zeta-Jones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film.  Don Cheadle is superb in his role.  Michael Douglas gives his usual performance while Erika Christensen does a good job as his daughter.  Topher Grace (of TV's That 70's Show) is excellent as her upper-class, druggie boyfriend.  Dennis Quid's character, while played adequately, is underused.The stories were shot using various filters and lenses, neatly separating them as the film went from one to another and adding to the viewing pleasure of the movie. Mexico is filmed through a hand held camera and yellow lens to give it a dry, grainy, shaky look that heightens the feel of unrest involved with Del Toro's situation.  Douglas' story is initially filmed in a hue of solemn, comforting blue.  Zeta-Jones' story is filmed without the use of lenses, suggesting that her situation and actions are the most realistic and achievable of all those presented.Despite some dialogue that spouts off statistics and seems a bit preachy, Traffic ranks among the top ten films of 2000, surpassing even Soderbergh's other venture, Erin Brokovich.  Don't be surprised if this film picks up the Oscar for Best Picture.By film's end, the message is clear and powerful. The fight against drugs is a long, uphill battle, but it is better than no battle at all.",positive,"[['the year', 'director', 'Steven Soderbergh', 'film', 'Erin Brokovich', 'the box', 'office', 'critical acclaim'], ['the release', 'film', 'Traffic', 'Soderbergh', 'Oscar', 'Best Director', 'Best', 'Picture'], ['no wonder', 'Traffic', 'the war', 'United', 'Mexico', 'the view', 'a whole', 'personal level'], ['the film', 'the near impossibility', 'the drug', 'trade', 'US', 'each year', 'that cause'], [], ['Soderbergh', 'message', 'effectively.The first story', 'Benicio Del Toro', 'Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez'], ['A cop', 'Baja', 'Mexico', 'the law', 'time', 'time'], ['a huge drug', 'bust', 'Juarez', 'drug', 'cartel', 'General Salazar', 'the credit'], ['Javier', 'partner', 'Salazar', 'the war', 'Obregon', 'cartel', 'Tijuana', 'some time.Meanwhile', 'Judge Robert Wakefield', 'Michael Douglas', 'Ohio Supreme Court', 'President', 'the nation', 'new leader', 'the drug', 'war'], ['the judge', 'the drug', 'war', 'San Diego', 'Monty', 'Don Cheadle', 'Ray', 'Luis Guzman', 'a drug', 'bust', 'a slimy drug', 'supplier', 'Eduardo Ruiz', 'Miguel Ferrer'], ['the drug', 'food', 'chain', 'Carlos Ayala', 'a well-to-do suburban man', 'the country', 'Mexico'], ['arrest', 'pregnant wife', 'Helena', 'Katherine Zeta-Jones', 'the film', 'care', 'son', 'court', 'dollar', 'debt', 'the drug', 'Mexico.Traffic', 'Simon Moore', 'the writer', 'Traffik', 'this script'], ['each character'], ['a fairy tale'], ['the realism', 'the movie'], ['the intertwining', 'home', 'the fact', 'script', 'the phenomenal', 'ensemble cast'], ['Del Toro', 'Golden Globe', 'Best Supporting Actress', 'Actor', 'a drama', 'this film'], ['Don Cheadle', 'role'], ['Michael Douglas', 'usual performance', 'Erika Christensen', 'a good job', 'daughter'], ['Grace', 'TV', 'Show', 'upper-class', 'druggie boyfriend'], ['Dennis Quid', 'character', 'the film', 'the viewing pleasure', 'the movie'], ['Mexico', 'a hand', 'camera', 'shaky look', 'the feel', 'Del Toro', 'situation'], ['Douglas', 'story', 'a hue', 'solemn', 'blue'], ['story', 'the use', 'situation', 'some dialogue', 'a bit', 'the top ten', 'Soderbergh', 'other venture', 'Erin Brokovich'], ['this film', 'Oscar', 'Best Picture.By', 'film', 'end', 'the message'], ['The fight', 'uphill battle', 'no battle']]","[['year', 'director Steven Soderbergh', 'film', 'Erin Brokovich', 'box office', 'critical acclaim'], ['release', 'film', 'Traffic', 'Soderbergh', 'Oscar nominations', 'Best Director', 'Best Picture', 'movies'], ['wonder', 'Traffic', 'gripping films', 'theatres', 'complex issues', 'war on drugs', 'United States', 'Mexico', 'view', 'nations', 'whole', 'personal level'], ['film', 'stories', 'near impossibility', 'drug trade', 'dollars', 'US', 'year', 'cause'], ['tales', 'characters', 'cross paths'], ['elements', 'Soderbergh', 'message', 'story features Benicio Del Toro', 'Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez'], ['cop in Baja', 'Mexico', 'law', 'wheels', 'time', 'time'], ['drug bust', 'Juarez drug cartel', 'General Salazar', 'drugs', 'credit'], ['Javier', 'partner', 'Salazar', 'war on drugs', 'Obregon cartel', 'Tijuana', 'time.Meanwhile', 'States', 'Judge Robert Wakefield', 'Michael Douglas', 'Ohio Supreme Court', 'President', 'nation', 'new leader', 'drug war'], ['judge', 'drug war', 'San Diego', 'Monty', 'Don Cheadle', 'Ray', 'Luis Guzman', 'federal agents', 'drug bust', 'drug supplier', 'Eduardo Ruiz', 'Miguel Ferrer'], ['events', 'drug food chain', 'Carlos Ayala', 'well-to-do suburban man', 'illegal drugs', 'country from Mexico'], ['arrest', 'pregnant wife', 'Helena', 'Katherine Zeta-Jones', 'film', 'care', 'son', 'court costs', 'dollar debt', 'drug lords', 'Mexico.Traffic', 'Simon Moore', 'writer', 'British miniseries', 'Traffik', 'script'], ['character', 'motives', 'courses'], ['films', 'matters', 'fairy tale'], ['realism', 'issues', 'movie'], ['intertwining stories', 'home', 'fact that drugs', 'script', 'phenomenal', 'ensemble cast'], ['Zeta-Jones', 'Del Toro', 'Golden Globe nominations', 'Best Supporting Actress', 'Actor', 'drama', 'roles', 'film'], ['Don Cheadle', 'role'], ['Michael Douglas', 'performance while Erika Christensen', 'good job', 'daughter'], ['Grace', 'TV', 'Show', 'upper-class', 'druggie boyfriend'], ['Dennis Quid', 'character', 'underused.The stories', 'various filters and lenses', 'film', 'viewing pleasure', 'movie'], ['Mexico', 'hand', 'camera', 'yellow lens', 'shaky look', 'feel', 'Del Toro', 'situation'], ['Douglas', 'story', 'hue of solemn', 'blue'], ['Zeta-Jones', 'story', 'use of lenses', 'situation and actions', 'dialogue', 'statistics', 'bit', 'Traffic ranks', 'ten films', 'Soderbergh', 'other venture', 'Erin Brokovich'], ['film', 'Oscar for Best Picture.By film', 'end', 'message'], ['fight against drugs', 'uphill battle', 'battle']]"

416,Funny Games,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0416903/,"From the opening credits, ""Funny Games"" is already playing tricks on the audience: as the film's family/victims drive to their summer home, listening to classical music, Haneke splices freakout thrash metal over shots of their unsuspecting faces. But what truly impressed me about this film wasn't the slight gimmicks (of which there are plenty, some more successful than others) but the muted, unobtrusive style in which the film is shot. Extremely long takes (like the first egg scene, or the harrowing, sparse shot of the father sitting in his living room floor, howling for his dead son) combined with elegant cinematography and lighting ( I liked how quite subtly the family's first interrogation grew darker and darker, until Paul commented upon it and turned on the lamp) never makes the camera feel an aloof presence to a choreographed scene. That is, until Paul turns, and in a Goddardian aside, winks knowingly at the camera's eye. At which point the audience is instantly implicated in the vicious proceedings. It seems here that most people get caught up in trying to explain the film's intentions. ""Funny Games"" isn't a film so much as a cinematic exercise in the spurious shock of violence on the silver screen. Gone are all the scapegoats of plot or genre conventions that would help make the audience feel vindicated or justified in watching, say, a man get shot because earlier he raped the film's protagonist, etc. But Haneke's film doesn't shock for the simple exploitative aspect either. When the mother is forced to strip before her torturers, the audience is kept just as blind to the proceedings as the young boy. Likewise, we don't witness the child's murder, but hear it off screen, as Paul is making himself something to eat. The films shock therefore comes not only from the brutal torture scenes but the intense apathy conveyed not only by the purposeless killers but the lack of cinematic conviction commonly combined with narrative violence, a point all the more reinforced with the film's final murder. As Peter and Paul are sailing back into the harbor, Paul comments how seeing violence in a film is no different than witnessing it in real life. The violence portrayed in ""Funny Games"" is so unnerving not because of any excessive display of exploitative gore, but for the exact opposite: the banal regularity of which such atrocities occur. ""Funny Games"" is anything but...but as is proven by the scores of reader responses, it's sure to provoke some reaction.

The story follows the logic of a nightmare; uneasy tension gives way to unreal horror as you stare in disbelief at what's happening on screen.

It's something of an underrated gem that has gained cult status in recent years, mostly due to its connection to The Matrix. The film, depending on what version you watch, maintains ambiguity till the end and slowly gives you answers. This isn't an action film like its bigger and more commercially successful brother (The Matrix), it's a neo-noir that has many tropes of the genre. Dark City is also a visually stunning film with moody lighting, detailed sets and fantastic model work. The performances the main actors give excellently convey that sense of cluelessness.If you're a fan of The Matrix, this is also a film you need to see because not only do they have similar plots, they also retain some of the same sets. Both were filmed in Fox studios in Sydney during the late 90's so there's lots of speculation what film's idea was first. This is not to say The Matrix is inferior, it's one of the best action movies of that decade or heck of all time. Although I do think Dark City deals with its themes of reality more thoroughly. Essentially I think the first thirty minutes of The Matrix are the whole of Dark City.I had the privilege of seeing this in the theatre in its original 35mm print and I have to say it looked absolutely incredible.

Everyone is under the control of mysterious 'strangers' who are injecting them with false memories/altering their reality. This man (Rufus Sewell) finally confronts these men in a battle for the city.This is one of those films that inspires you to learn more about sci/fi. The whole movie is cold, dark and it never lights up for a minute. This movie is an underrated brilliant sci-fi film and it bares a resemblance to 'The Matrix', but was made before it, so there is no denying that Dark City must have been an inspiration for The Matrix.The story is complex but develops itself as a frequently entertaining thriller. It is thought provoking, which is a lesser thing you'll find in films today. You'll sit there thinking about life after viewing this film. It can easily been our future if we head down the road we are on.The performances are all very good, specially the three lead men. Rufus Sewell plays the confused lead, William Hurt plays the film noir detective and Kiefer Sutherland is the quirky side switching doctor. Don't forget Jennifer Connellywho plays the role with great expertise. Alex Proyas much like The Crow has created this Gothic world where the sun never rises and inhabitants live in darkness. The sets and costumes are beautiful. The acting is top-of-the-line, with Sewell in the lead part. Everyone does a great job.The villains in this film, THE STRANGERS, are creepy and will send chills down your spine every time you see them in their long black coats and hat. The costumes for them are perfect and could not have been done better, they live in the world underground and you see the different lifestyles between them and the people they control, yet live above them.The thing that amazed me the most would be the cross between the 1950 to 1980's, it was brilliant, the set pieces were perfect for this film.

The images of what happens to the boys are sensational but realistic, avoiding, except at one key point, the kind of triumphal uprising-against-the-system plot line that normally takes over. Here there are no heroes and no courage - just blunt brutality.Unfortunately, the second half of the film, in which convoluted courtroom-revenge theatrics take over, is unable to deliver such a punch. The only interesting character from the prison meets his end far too early, and we are left, apparently, to cheer on the demise of characters whom we have only seen in half-glimpsed slow-motion fragments. We know nothing of them, and don't care about their plight, other than in a general 'they're bad so they must die' Hollywood kind of way.We are also asked to support a priest who lies under oath to protect two boys who, by their own admission, have murdered a man in the middle of a bar. That several witnesses saw the murders happen in front of them is ignored by the end of the film - all logic having been cast to the four winds to support a system of values which, while intuitively just, is, on reflection, highly tenuous.An interesting film, then, but one which needed less Hollywoodisation and a little more thoughtfulness.",negative,"[['The first hour', 'Sleepers', 'the account', 'fall'], ['key', 'point', 'the kind', 'triumphal uprising-against-the-system plot', 'line'], ['no courage', 'blunt', 'the second half', 'the film', 'courtroom-revenge', 'a punch'], ['The only interesting character', 'the prison', 'end', 'the demise', 'half-glimpsed slow-motion'], ['nothing', 'plight', 'Hollywood', 'kind', 'way.We', 'a priest', 'oath', 'own admission', 'a man', 'the middle', 'a bar'], ['front', 'the end', 'the film', 'a system', 'reflection', 'tenuous.An interesting', 'film', 'Hollywoodisation', 'thoughtfulness']]","[['hour of Sleepers', 'account', 'protagonists', 'fall', 'hands', 'oppressors', 'subsequent atrocities'], ['images', 'boys', 'key point', 'kind', 'plot line'], ['heroes', 'courage', 'blunt', 'second half', 'film', 'courtroom-revenge theatrics', 'punch'], ['only interesting character', 'prison', 'end', 'demise of characters', 'slow-motion fragments'], ['nothing', 'plight', 'Hollywood kind', 'way.We', 'priest', 'oath', 'boys', 'own admission', 'man', 'middle', 'bar'], ['several witnesses', 'murders', 'front', 'end', 'film', 'winds', 'system of values', 'reflection', 'interesting film', 'Hollywoodisation', 'thoughtfulness']]"
423,Sleepers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0973266/,"This movie made a fuss when it came out because there were claims that its author had lied about it being ""based on a true story."" As a result it become a sort of infamous title and people cared less about the film's content and more about its ""accuracies.""Well, frankly I don't really care about whether or not the story is true because I know things similar to this _do_ happen - children are abused and using this as a backbone for a revenge film may seem a bit inappropriate but it is handled with care by director Barry Levinson and the highly talented ensemble cast treat it with caution.Robert De Niro gives a convincing performance as the Catholic priest who is a father-figure to a bunch of disillusioned Brooklyn youth. After they accidentally injure a man during a rebellious incident they are sent away to a juvenile facility where they are sexually and physically abused by the evil warden (Kevin Bacon). Years later two of the boys (now grown men) take revenge on Bacon and kill him in a public area. They are sent to trial but not all is what it seems - representing the case is someone involved with the past and there are some other interesting twists along the way.The abuse isn't really the subject of this movie - instead the ""what if a trial could be rigged?"" question is more prescient. (Think ""Runaway Jury"" meets ""Deliverance."") The cast is fantastic - De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver, Bacon, et al. It's a movie buff's dream come true! If only Al Pacino had popped up....De Niro has been given a bad reputation lately as a ""sell-out"" - but he provides a really deep and multi-layered performance here. It's too bad people forget about this movie along with some others he made around the turn of the decade because a lot of them were very good. This is one of them.Levinson (""Rain Man,"" ""Diner"") is sometimes a bit too heavy on schmaltz in his films and that's the reason many people (myself NOT included) disliked ""Rain Man.""

424,Lost Highway,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0390103/,"""Lost Highway"" is a great many things, but often seems to be reduced to a love-it or hurts-my-head-from-the-confusion, so-I'll-just-dismiss-it kind of movie. Some critics have written it off as self-indulgent swill, saying that only people who could hope to appreciate it would be Lynch himself and his plethora of wide-eyed adoring fans, etc, etc. I myself have never actually been a huge fan of Lynch, perhaps because I thought his stories didn't take themselves seriously enough, were just too darn quirky, who knows. Still, I've always admired his talent for creating beautiful, disturbing imagery, and ""Lost Highway"" has to be my favorite film of his, and possibly one of the most beautiful and mesmerizing I've ever seen! Certainly not for everyone, as those who want a definitive ""answer,"" who think that seeing it again and again is really going to explain everything, or those who are simply into the ol' explosion-packed action blockbusters are going to be left shaking their heads. It's definitely open to interpretation. Myself, I'm not one to offer any new insight, I view it as--SPOILER AHEAD??--a purely subjective movie, with nearly all the events seen and largely imagined by its protagonist, Fred Madison, and once you can simply accept him as insane (or at least very imaginative!) you can simply quit puzzling over it and allow yourself to enjoy the ride.While incarcerated for killing his wive in an act of jealousy, he embarks on a ""psychogenic fugue"" as an act of last-minute escapism from the looming dread of his upcoming execution--sort of like Ambrose Bierce's ""Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge""--imagining himself as a younger, more likable/worthwhile guy (valued auto mechanic, ""Mr. Eddy's"" favorite), with people who care about him (his parents and girlfriend, as opposed to his real-life murdered wife who didn't even bother to go to his musical performances), and definitely more virile, as he is able to both attract and fulfill his ""wife"" (seen here as the slutty, icy femme fatale-type he always suspected her to be). However, try as he may, he ultimately can't avoid his past (notice how the fantasy him is put off when he hears Fred's jazz song on the radio in the garage), and thus after the fantasy Alice/Renee rejects him in the desert, he immediately turns back into his typical view of himself--hurt, older, sensitive, vulnerable (represented by his nakedness)--proving that even his fantasies fail him, and thus he's left to die an unpleasant death in the electric chair after all (notice the way he violently contorts in the closing moments, almost as if he's being electrocuted). Call him a modern-day murderous Walter Mitty I guess. The Fred Madison/O.J. Simpson comparisons made by some are interesting--if just a BIT cynical!--though I have to halfway wonder if that real-life spousal jealousy murder case provided any grain of inspiration for this fictional one. The cast is impressive and do a great job; Bill Pullman definitely has the haunted, deer-in-the-headlights look that his confused, out-of-it character requires, though at the same time I don't know if he quite portrays the extreme jealousy and animal savageness deep down inside that caused him to murder his wife as gruesomely as he did (if of course you even want to accept what was on that final videotape as something that actually happened in the first place!). Needless to say, the whole moebius-strip ""twist"" of having the film end at its beginning greatly complicates any interpretation; even without it, the film could STILL be difficult to decipher by some (heck, I'm still not even really sure what the significance of the Mystery Man was!)Perhaps the film could have benefited from a few extra scenes or lines of dialogue to make it a little less cryptic for the more literal-minded members of the audience, but still, even by suggesting that you'd be implying that there was one concrete explanation for the film, which there most certainly is not.Regardless, all plot and interpretations aside, you can almost certainly enjoy for its images, its music (an EXCELLENT soundtrack), for its mood and atmosphere, and simply for it as a whole: dare I say, it's almost more of an experience than anything (though for what it's worth, at the same time I can't think of the last time I saw a film--or work of art period, for that matter--that provoked such a wide variety of interpretations and opinions, as should hopefully be the case with ANY great work of art).Fascinating.",negative,"[['Highway', 'hurts-my-head-from-the-confusion', ""so-I'll-just-dismiss-it kind"", 'movie'], ['self-indulgent', 'swill', 'Lynch', 'plethora', 'wide-eyed adoring'], ['a huge fan', 'Lynch'], ['talent', 'imagery', 'Highway', 'favorite film'], ['everyone', 'answer', 'everything', 'the ol', 'explosion-packed action'], ['interpretation'], ['Myself', 'any new insight', 'SPOILER AHEAD'], ['subjective movie', 'protagonist', 'Fred Madison', 'insane'], ['the ride.While', 'wive', 'an act', 'jealousy', 'psychogenic fugue', 'an act', 'last-minute escapism', 'dread', 'upcoming execution', 'sort', 'Ambrose Bierce', 'Occurence', 'Owl Creek Bridge', 'likable/worthwhile guy', 'auto', 'mechanic', 'Mr. Eddy', 'favorite', 'girlfriend', 'real-life', 'wife', 'both attract', 'wife', 'the slutty', 'icy', 'fatale-type'], ['past', 'the fantasy', 'Fred', 'jazz', 'song', 'the radio', 'the garage', 'Alice/Renee', 'the desert', 'typical view', 'hurt', 'nakedness', 'an unpleasant death', 'the electric chair', 'the way', 'the closing'], ['Walter Mitty'], ['Fred Madison/O.J'], ['Simpson', 'BIT', 'that real-life spousal', 'jealousy', 'murder', 'case', 'any grain', 'inspiration'], ['The cast', 'a great job', 'Bill Pullman', 'deer-in-the-headlights look', 'out-of-it character', 'the same time', 'the extreme jealousy', 'animal savageness', 'wife', 'course', 'that final videotape', 'something', 'the first place'], ['Needless', 'the whole moebius-strip', 'twist', 'the film', 'end', 'any interpretation', 'the film', 'the significance', 'Mystery', 'Man'], ['the film', 'dialogue', 'the audience', 'concrete explanation', 'the film', 'all plot', 'music', 'EXCELLENT', 'soundtrack', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'a whole', 'dare', 'an experience', 'anything', 'the same time', 'the last time', 'a film', 'work', 'art period', 'that matter', 'a wide variety', 'the case', 'ANY', 'great work', 'art', '.Fascinating']]","[['Highway', 'great many things', 'hurts-my-head-from-the-confusion', 'kind of movie'], ['critics', 'self-indulgent swill', 'people', 'Lynch', 'plethora', 'adoring fans'], ['fan of Lynch', 'stories', 'darn quirky'], ['talent', 'imagery', 'Highway', 'favorite film'], ['everyone', 'answer', 'everything', 'ol', 'action blockbusters', 'heads'], ['interpretation'], ['Myself', 'new insight', 'SPOILER AHEAD'], ['subjective movie', 'events', 'protagonist', 'Fred Madison', 'insane'], ['ride.While', 'wive', 'act of jealousy', 'psychogenic fugue', 'act', 'last-minute escapism', 'dread', 'upcoming execution', 'sort of like Ambrose Bierce', 'Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge', 'likable/worthwhile guy', 'auto mechanic', 'Mr. Eddy', 'favorite', 'people', 'parents and girlfriend', 'real-life', 'wife', 'musical performances', 'attract', 'wife', 'slutty', 'icy', 'fatale-type'], ['past', 'fantasy', 'Fred', 'jazz song', 'radio', 'garage', 'fantasy Alice/Renee', 'desert', 'typical view', 'hurt', 'nakedness', 'fantasies', 'unpleasant death', 'electric chair', 'way', 'closing moments'], ['Walter Mitty'], ['Fred Madison/O.J'], ['Simpson comparisons', 'BIT', 'spousal jealousy murder case', 'grain of inspiration'], ['cast', 'great job', 'Bill Pullman', 'deer-in-the-headlights look', 'out-of-it character', 'same time', 'extreme jealousy', 'animal savageness', 'wife', 'course', 'videotape as something', 'first place'], ['Needless', 'whole moebius-strip', 'twist', 'film end', 'interpretation', 'film', 'significance', 'Mystery Man'], ['film', 'few extra scenes', 'lines of dialogue', 'literal-minded members', 'audience', 'concrete explanation', 'film', 'plot and interpretations', 'images', 'music', 'EXCELLENT soundtrack', 'mood and atmosphere', 'whole', 'dare', 'experience than anything', 'same time', 'last time', 'film', 'work', 'art period', 'matter', 'variety of interpretations', 'opinions', 'case with ANY', 'work of art', '.Fascinating']]"
425,Lost Highway,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1188961/,"Just watched this for the first time, and enjoyed it immensely. Some here have suggested that there's no 'real' story at all. I don't agree: Lynch doesn't work like that - no matter how bizarre and reticulated, there's a story there, all right, but you have to dig for it.'Mulholland Drive' informs this film considerably. Having deconstructed that one to my satisfaction, I have a clearer view of how Lynch does things; how he shows us the elements, the language he uses, and what he leaves out for us to discover. So, then - *SPOILERS*, if I'm right:As with MD, there's a big clue in the first few seconds: Fred is shown in close-up, looking thoroughly wrecked, smoking a cigarette unsteadily. There's a buzzing sound, and light sweeps across his face and the room. *The sound is one you'll become familiar with later, in the jailhouse.* Fred looks up, warily.Major premise: I believe this scene shows Fred, in the last moments of his life, having his last cigarette before they come to take him to the chair. This may, in fact, be the only 'real' scene in the film, with everything else being Fred's distorted recollection, and the rest a psychotic break fantasy he constructs to escape from his grim situation.As the door to his cell opens, Fred rejects the awfulness of reality, and transforms the buzz into the sound of his door intercom, and at this point we go into his personal flashback as the story continues.The acting and dialogue is often stilted and unrealistic in this flashback. What we're seeing is Fred's recollection, which - as he himself says - is not necessarily the way it actually happened. His relationship with Renee is tense and unreal, with lots of suppressed rage. Cleverly, the undercurrents are conveyed mostly by the background sounds - listed in the credits as 'Ominous drones' - and these provide the significance that the dialogue alone would lack.At the party scene several events take place: his suspicions about Renee and the impossibly sleazy - because he's seen through Fred's eyes - lounge-lizard Andy are effectively confirmed (for him). And he meets the 'Mystery Man', a devil-figure who tells Fred ""You invited me (into your home). It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted"". I suspect that this figure is Fred's attempt to unload his guilt onto someone else: a 'devil who made him do it' - don't you have to invite the devil into your house? Perhaps he's the personification of Fred's insanity, or his jealousy. Or all of the above - all the dark influences in Fred's life and head.As the flashback continues, we see the progression up to the point where he finally does murder Renee, horribly. Again he attempts to reject the reality by showing it all on video, but reality intrudes and a few seconds are shown of him 'really' sitting among the dismembered parts of his wife. His subsequent trial and sentencing are skipped over - they're a blur to Fred - and he winds up on Death Row.Facing execution, and unable to tolerate his real state, Fred then creates a fantasy in which he escapes his fate by miraculously turning into another person - an innocent: young, enjoying a simple life, good at his simple job; with groovy, understanding parents and a pliable girlfriend.The scenes around Fred's miraculous replacement are classic Lynch fantasy-made-real: the dialogue is ludicrous; the events comic-book. We see the same in the fantasy world of the central character in MD.Although safe in this new fantastical environment, Fred/Peter is unable to resist being drawn back into danger, initially via his unlikely relationship with the - again comic-book - gangster boss, Mr. Eddy. This gangster character is a one-dimensional, violent crazy man who recalls the fantasy mafia types invented by the central character in MD to 'explain' her bad break.Even so, Peter's life will remain peaceful if he avoids any dealings with Eddy outside of the grease-monkey relationship. But Fred's paranoia demands danger, and Peter begins an even less plausible and obviously perilous association with Fred's new incarnation of Renee: the pure-hearted damsel in distress that is Alice.Except that, once again, Peter's life is contorted by Fred's paranoia, and Alice slowly metamorphoses into a spiteful, greedy psychotic who leads Peter further into danger. (I looked for the 'Eye of the Duck' peripeteiac scene that Lynch always puts into his films, and one of the candidates is, I think, the moment where Alice points the gun at him after raiding 'Andy's' house. The tableau is held long enough to allow you to contemplate all that could happen if she shoots Peter and takes off. But that's not possible in a Fred/Peter fantasy, so we continue, with the point about her ruthlessness made.)What else? The storyline continues as might be expected, with Alice now in total control. The cabin we've seen before just prior to Fred's metamorphosis. Alice disappears. The Mystery Man returns, and so does Mr. Eddy and Fred. All of this in a fight, during which the devil-figure hands him a knife that allows him to defeat Eddy/Dick Laurent (as we have discovered), and finally everything turns to crap as Fred heads back onto the highway with retribution on his tail. Things look hopeless, and the escape fantasy has brought him back to the point where he came in.And then Fred begins another metamorphosis, which we never see completed, and the film ends. Is this another fantasy escape, or his death in the Chair? I don't know how much of this is correct. Perhaps one day someone will tie Mr. Lynch to a rack, put electrodes on his nuts, and extract the line-by-line details of his wonderful creations. Until then we must wonder and worry.

426,Die Hard with a Vengeance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0360391/,"I have to say that I was really impressed with this Die Hard film, the trilogy has just been an awesome one. This time we have a new partner, Samuel L. Jackson, who works so well with Bruce, they have such a great chemistry as partners in the film. Die Hard: With a Vengeance is a worthy sequel of the original Die Hard. It has great action, a terrific story, and in some ways it's just a fun comedy. I loved how John just wouldn't stop complaining about the aspirin since he has a hang over from the night before. Especially his line when he finally gets aspirin from the main villain, it was just priceless. I think you'll definitely love this Die Hard if you are a fan.John is no longer at base one in life, he's actually farther behind I think, he's pretty much lost everything since his nasty drinking problem. He's suffering from a bad hang over this one morning and things get worse when he is threatened by an unknown villain to stand in the middle of the worst ghetto city wearing an offensive poster, right as he's about to get his butt killed, Zeus, a shop owner helps him out, but ends up getting involved. It turns out that the villain is Hans Gruber's brother, Simon Gruber, who is about to do everything his brother supposedly did wrong and will get the money. But John is going to make sure that he puts the Gruber name to shame.Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an excellent action movie, it was a lot of fun and I couldn't believe how well it was made. Sam and Bruce are just perfect together. Jeremy Irons could not be more perfect for the role of Simon, he and Alan are so much alike where they have the most awesome voices for super bad villains. Yes, a little typecast for being a British villain, but it's all good, I think. I highly recommend Die Hard: With a Veneance, it's a great movie and a great end to the trilogy.9/10",negative,"[['Die Hard', 'film', 'the trilogy'], ['This time', 'a new partner', 'Samuel L.

427,Die Hard with a Vengeance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336089/,"Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) is the third film in the popular Die Hard franchise, which re teamed Bruce Willis with John McTiernan, the director of the first film. It is my second favorite Die Hard film in the franchise. It feel's fast paced, more realistic and more action movie to me. It is not boring or slow, I love the characters: John McClane, Zeus Carver, Simon Gruber, Joe Lambert, Connie Kowalski, Charlie Weiss, Katya and Mathias Targo. No CGI real action sequences, real explosions, real stunt performances. McClane fires a power line, severing it in to the helicopter blowing up the chopper to pieces amazing my personal favorite scene. I love this movie to death, this is my movie and it is my personal favorite action film. Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) is a near-perfect summer movie. It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is so good as the first one, I couldn't decide which one I love to Death: Die Hard or Die Hard With a Vengeance. I love this movie to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in Die Hard series and action films. I love the original Die Hard to death but I love this sequel much more. That's my personal opinion. This franchise effort is a gleeful no-brainer with nonstop action. Die Hard With A Vengeance I really do believe is the greatest action sequel and a true masterpiece to the first movie. It gives some additional action pleasure, as we get to watch action heroes Bruce Willis get smacked around for 128 minutes. In this third outing with John McClane, we are faced with yet another mad bomber on the loose. Jeremy Irons plays Simon, an East German Special Forces Colonel-turned-terrorist mastermind and the older brother of Hans Gruber, who has a score to settle with Detective McClane. Simon's bombing game comes complete with crafty riddles, which must be solved in a specified time or everything goes boom. McClane has no choice but to play. Along the way, he picks up an unlikely accomplice named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper. Together they tear all over New York trying to head off disaster. Sure, it's all perfectly preposterous, but DIE HARD 3 has been directed with breathless intensity by John McTiernan, who certainly has a way with wrecking things. Was he very destructive as a child? Loved the spectacular subway crash, John. That hair-raising taxi ride through Central Park wasn't bad, either. I love the fact that they are saving kids from school. Charlie try's to disabled the bomb in school while Kowalski and Lambert are saving those kids stuck in the building I love that scene. McClane and Carver are desperately searching for the code for the bomb to disabled it, I love it to death. Don't forget to fasten your seat belts for this ride. It's often said that McTiernan and Hensleigh simply ignored Die Hard 2, and in terms of direct plot and dialogue references, this may be true, but they still give Die Hard 2 a nod by having an attendant humor--often almost ""goofy"" humor--in many action scenes. One of the most direct nods occurs with McClane ""riding"" something of an explosion (of water this time). This is one of the more hilarious scenes of the film.Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action film and the third in the Die Hard film series. It was produced and directed by John McTiernan (who directed Die Hard), written by Jonathan Hensleigh, and stars Bruce Willis as New York City Police Department Lieutenant John McClane, Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, and Jeremy Irons as Simon Peter Gruber. Twenty years ago, after two blockbuster movies and a five-year wait, the ""Die Hard"" franchise roared back into theaters with the explosive ""Die Hard with a Vengeance."" The movie was released on May 19, 1995, and it was an instant classic, thanks to a smart script, exciting plot, and the absolutely stellar chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. But not only was ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" a great movie, it was also arguably the best of its kind: unstoppable, and untoppable.Die Hard With A Vengeance was filmed before CGI made it possible to create scenes like this without breaking a single window, this moment is utter, terrifying perfection.How often do you get an action flick where the heroes spend the entire first half of the film solving puzzles to save lives? In a franchise that distinguishes itself with action that toes the line between ""creative"" and ""ridiculous,"" ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" stays on brand, in the best way.John McClane and a Harlem store owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building. 10/10 Score: bad Ass Seal Of Approval my personal second favorite Die Hard action movie.",positive,"[['Die Hard', 'Vengeance', 'the third film', 'Die Hard', 'franchise', 'Bruce Willis', 'John McTiernan', 'the director', 'the first film'], ['Die Hard', 'film', 'the franchise'], ['fast', 'action', 'movie'], ['John McClane', 'Zeus Carver', 'Simon Gruber', 'Joe Lambert', 'Connie Kowalski', 'Charlie Weiss', 'Katya', 'Mathias Targo'], ['CGI', 'real action', 'real stunt'], ['McClane', 'a power', 'line', 'the helicopter', 'the chopper', 'personal favorite scene'], ['this movie', 'death', 'movie', 'personal favorite action', 'film'], ['Die Hard', 'A Vengeance', 'a near-perfect summer', 'movie'], ['personal favorite action'], ['Death', 'Die Hard', 'Die Hard', 'a Vengeance'], ['this movie', 'death', 'number', 'favorite action', 'film', 'Die Hard', 'series', 'action'], ['Die Hard', 'death', 'this sequel'], ['personal opinion'], ['This franchise', 'effort', 'a gleeful no-brainer', 'nonstop action'], ['Die Hard', 'A Vengeance', 'action', 'sequel', 'a true masterpiece', 'the first movie'], ['some additional action', 'pleasure', 'action', 'Bruce Willis'], ['John McClane', 'another mad bomber', 'the loose'], ['Jeremy Irons', 'Simon', 'Colonel-turned-terrorist mastermind', 'brother', 'Hans Gruber', 'a score', 'Detective McClane'], ['Simon', 'bombing', 'game', 'a specified time', 'everything', 'boom'], ['McClane', 'no choice'], ['the way', 'an unlikely accomplice', 'Zeus', 'Samuel L.

428,A Perfect World,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2656513/,"""A Perfect World"", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick.It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10",negative,"[['World', 'a seldom-mentioned entry', 'Clint Eastwood', 'a riveting character', 'study', 'Kevin Costner', 'an escaped con', 'year-old boy', 'hostage', 'getaway'], ['chase', 'Eastwood', 'Texas Ranger', 'the fetching', 'Laura Dern', 'bookworm', 'tagalong'], ['A bond', 'captor', 'the film', 'emotional center'], ['Both con', 'child', 'something', 'a tragic father', 'figure', 'a surrogate sidekick.It', 'a slow burn', 'the only action', 'a speedy', 'getaway'], ['the relationship', 'the kid', 'cute', 'Costner', 'undercurrent', 'menace', 'hardened criminal'], ['a buildup', 'one', 'a climactic scene', 'everyone', 'a date', 'fate'], ['a movie', 'roll'], []]","[['Perfect World', 'entry in Clint Eastwood', 'credits', 'character study', 'Kevin Costner', 'escaped con', 'boy hostage', 'getaway'], ['chase', 'Eastwood', 'Texas Ranger', 'fetching Laura Dern', 'bookworm tagalong'], ['bond', 'captor', 'film', 'emotional center'], ['con and child', 'something', 'father figure', 'surrogate sidekick.It', 'slow burn', 'action scenes', 'speedy getaway', 'few gunshots'], ['relationship', 'feels', 'kid', 'cute', 'Costner', 'undercurrent of menace', 'hardened criminal'], ['buildup', 'one', 'climactic scene', 'everyone', 'date with fate'], ['movie', 'credits roll'], []]"
429,A Perfect World,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3530118/,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to 1993's A Perfect World. Plot In A Paragraph: Butch Haynes (KC) escapes from prison and kidnaps a young boy (T.J. Lowther) In hot pursuit is a Texas Ranger, Red Garrett (Clint Eastwood)A Perfect World is not a great movie, it's an underrated masterpiece that has somehow slipped through the cracks, despite great reviews (I remember one saying ""You'll be Unforgiven For Missing A Perfect World) it was overlooked on its initial release, and has been largely forgotten since. On paper, the film should have produced an instant box office hit. KC was Hollywoods golden boy, producing hit after hit (Dances With Wolves, Prince Of Thieves, JFK and The Bodyguard) whilst Eastwood had just won a pair of Oscars for Unforgiven, and had a hit with In The Line Of Fire, yet for some reason audiences stayed away. The trailers didn't really help, as they were uninspiring to say the least, and didn't convey the tone of the movie at all.I urge everybody to revisit it. Not only because A Perfect World features the best performance of KC's career, it may also the best movie Clint Eastwood has directed, yes I am including my own personal favourite, The Outlaw Josie Wales and Oscar winning Unforgiven in that statement. The movie has a prison break, a kidnapping and murders but it's not really about any of their things, it's so much deeper than that. The heart of the movie is the relationship between Butch and Phillip. Butch isn't a nice guy, we see plenty of examples of this, but he is kind to the boy, and Phillip isn't a cute movie kid, and with his natural performance and expressive face, he does not come off as a child actor either (which is the highest compliment I can give) This isn't just KC's best performance, it's probably my personal favourite KC performance too. It's amazing and combines everything that he is so good at. Butch is charming and sincere but also short tempered, (especially if he sees children being mistreated) unpredictable and very dangerous. Most of KC's scenes are with Lowther and the two have such great chemistry together that you really do feel the bond developing between them.Clint takes an unexpected back seat in this one, and that's fine. Also fine is Laura Dern (who I've always being strangely attracted to) playing a criminologist who isn't just along for the ride.While the movie could have easily been a bog standard chase movie, but it's patient pacing and its themes (father and son bonds) elevate it to greatness. Much like Unforgiven the movie is a warning about violence. Especially violence towards children. As a crime drama, it is effective and tense, but as a story of fathers and sons, it becomes something more poignant. It's a a deeply satisfying slow-burner that only improves with age. Worthy of note is the score by Lennie Niehaus (who Eastwood used often) and a track called Big Frans Baby, the location work and Eastwood's use of colours. Criminally over looked at the time of its release. A Perfect World ended the year 54th highest grossing movie of 1993, with a domestic gross of $31 million, to put that into context, Cop And A Half grossed more!! America should hang it's head in shame. Everyone who has seen it, should revisit this gem. If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend you do so. 10/10 for this reviewer.",positive,"[['plan', 'Kevin Costner', 'movie', 'order', 'Perfect World'], ['Plot', 'A Paragraph', 'Butch Haynes', 'KC', 'prison', 'a young boy', 'T.J.

430,Falling Down,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0965813/,"Take the hottest day of the year, a traffic gridlock, cracked pavements, dirty streets, unwarranted hostility and a general feeling of being short changed. Then add the frustrations of having an estranged wife and child, an extremely jaded and unbalanced mindset, and the frustration of being obsolete with no marketable skills. Set them against the decadent back drop of modern day LA where if you are 'Not economically viable,' you are of no use, and the result is Falling Down.The tag line 'The Adventures of an Ordinary man at War with the Everyday World,' makes Joel Schumacher's masterpiece sound like the benign story of a working stiff with issues. However Falling Down is a dark and engrossing urban fable, a study into the mind of the disenfranchised and reminder to all that the removal of comfort is a lot closer than we care to believe.Full of clichés, like the cop on his last day before retiring, Falling Down bravely meets all expectations of stereotypes, rather than challenging them, making for a realistic reflection of a failing society. Here, a man in extremis, without the feral cunning or killer instinct required for a life in the street, makes his way on anger and luck alone, somehow surviving to leave a paper chase of violence and destruction behind.Relying heavily on symbolism, illustrating a flip side of America running parallel to the hunky dory world occupied by the successful, the over all message of 'No Matter, Never Mind,' is clear in this world where children play next to vagrants dying from AIDS and Korean grocers can legally steal from the public with their overpriced goods.Michael Douglas displays some hitherto unseen talent as the unbalanced D-FENS, as he casually totes gang weapons (complete with rubber bands on the grips) in his formal shirt and tie, does battle with store owners and comes up against fast food restaurants, homeless people, gangsters and Nazis. Robert Duval is equally brilliant as the desk jockey on his final day, determined to stop anyone else from being hurt, including the perp.There is, of course, a small amount of Hollywood sentimentality thrown in for good measure, however the dynamics of such a strong narrative make this completely forgivable and it's possible to overlook this as a flaw given the film's overall strengths.Praise surely has to go to Ebbe Roe Smith for writing one of the finest scripts ever to grace celluloid. Known for bit parts and cameos, who the hell knows who Ebbe really is? Look on IMDb to find out (if you're a geek like me) or release him into the ether if you don't care. The truth is, he's out there. The question is: Where's the next script?On the whole, Falling Down is a powerful and dramatic indictment of American culture, societal decadence, and the failing values of the West. It's not for everyone and will most certainly offend some, but if approached with an open mind, will provide plenty of fuel for thought.",negative,"[['day', 'the year', 'a traffic', 'gridlock', 'unwarranted hostility', 'a general feeling'], ['an estranged wife', 'child', 'unbalanced mindset', 'the frustration'], ['the decadent', 'drop', 'modern day', 'LA', 'no use', 'the result', 'Down.The', 'tag', 'line', 'Adventures', 'an Ordinary man', 'War', 'Everyday World', 'Joel Schumacher', 'masterpiece', 'sound', 'the benign story', 'stiff'], ['a dark', 'a study', 'the mind', 'the removal', 'comfort', 'a lot', 'clichés', 'the cop', 'last day', 'a realistic reflection', 'a failing society'], ['a man', 'extremis', 'the feral cunning', 'instinct', 'a life', 'the street', 'way', 'anger', 'luck', 'a paper', 'chase', 'violence', 'destruction', 'symbolism', 'a flip side', 'America', 'the hunky', 'dory', 'world', 'all message', 'Matter', 'Never Mind', 'this world', 'AIDS', 'Korean', 'the public', 'overpriced goods.Michael', 'Douglas', 'some hitherto', 'unseen talent', 'D-FENS', 'rubber', 'formal shirt', 'tie', 'battle', 'store', 'food', 'homeless', 'Nazis'], ['Robert Duval', 'the desk', 'jockey', 'final day', 'anyone', 'the perp.There', 'course', 'a small amount', 'Hollywood', 'sentimentality', 'thrown', 'good measure', 'a strong narrative make', 'a flaw', 'the film', 'overall strengths.Praise', 'Ebbe Roe Smith', 'celluloid'], ['bit', 'the hell', 'Ebbe'], ['IMDb', 'a geek', 'the ether'], ['The truth'], ['The question', 'the next script', 'the whole', 'dramatic indictment', 'American culture', 'societal decadence', 'West'], ['everyone', 'an open mind', 'plenty', 'fuel', 'thought']]","[['day', 'year', 'traffic gridlock', 'cracked pavements', 'dirty streets', 'unwarranted hostility', 'general feeling'], ['frustrations', 'estranged wife and child', 'unbalanced mindset', 'frustration', 'marketable skills'], ['decadent', 'drop', 'day LA', 'use', 'result', 'Down.The tag line', 'Adventures', 'man at War', 'Everyday World', 'Joel Schumacher', 'masterpiece sound', 'benign story', 'stiff with issues'], ['dark', 'study', 'mind', 'removal of comfort', 'lot', 'clichés', 'cop', 'last day', 'expectations of stereotypes', 'realistic reflection', 'failing society'], ['man in extremis', 'feral cunning', 'instinct', 'life', 'street', 'way on anger', 'luck', 'paper chase', 'violence and destruction', 'symbolism', 'side of America', 'hunky dory world', 'message', ""'No Matter"", 'Never Mind', 'world', 'children', 'vagrants', 'AIDS', 'Korean grocers', 'public', 'goods.Michael Douglas', 'hitherto', 'unseen talent', 'unbalanced D-FENS', 'gang weapons', 'rubber bands', 'grips', 'formal shirt and tie', 'battle with store owners', 'food restaurants', 'homeless people', 'gangsters and Nazis'], ['Robert Duval', 'desk jockey', 'final day', 'anyone', 'perp.There', 'course', 'amount of Hollywood sentimentality thrown', 'good measure', 'dynamics', 'strong narrative make', 'flaw', 'film', 'overall strengths.Praise', 'Ebbe Roe Smith', 'scripts', 'celluloid'], ['bit parts', 'cameos', 'hell', 'Ebbe'], ['IMDb', 'geek', 'ether'], ['truth'], ['question', 'next script', 'whole', 'dramatic indictment', 'American culture', 'societal decadence', 'values', 'West'], ['everyone', 'open mind', 'plenty of fuel', 'thought']]"

There are so many parts that are just purely classic. You can relate to so many things in this movie. That's what the movie was trying to do. It was suppose to show you this little story about this average guy who goes off of the deep end... but then you look closer and you realize how many things you can truly relate to. How many things subconsciously frustrate you and how you never do anything about it. It shows how life is a double edged sword for some people, showing you that if you take matters into your own hands it comes back to you in the end and if you play by the rules you get screwed over. If you were to ask me what I thought about this film after I first saw it I would say that the movie was a cult classic. But sadly it's an underrated forgotten movie. I love this film.

432,The Hunt for Red October,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0283717/,"Fortuneately, this movie is not entirely true to Tom Clancy's vision and book.  Tom Clancy is an American superpatriot and nationalist.  He loves to gush about the superiority of the American military establishment and its high technology.  This movie puts a more sympathetic face on the Russians and the commoner's point of view. Sean Connery plays a very likable Russian Submarine Commander.  Of course, Sean Connery is always going to steal the show in any movie.  He's kind of like the John Wayne of the last twenty five years.  But the supporting actors are also engaging as well.  Scott Glenn, Fred Thompson, and James Earl Jones all do very well at commanding our attention.  These actors always give strong, interesting, and dynamic performances. With all the high technology and military hardware in this movie it is interesting to note how a simple seaman(an enlisted man at that!) solves the great technical puzzle in this movie.  All the officers, admirals, computers, aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and what have you are clearly stumped.  But, Jonesy, with simple reasoning and a keen intuition, solves the riddle that is the Red October.  Yes, he uses a computer to help him, but most importantly, he uses his mind! The strength of this movie is that with all the gadgetry and high technology, the human element is not lost but is always on top.  Plus, it does not degrade into pro-American propaganda.

435,The Abyss,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0265950/,"James Cameron is mostly known for his blockbuster hits like The Terminator(1984), Aliens(1986), Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991), True Lies(1994), and Titanic(1997).  Those films contained fast paced action as well as tense moments of human emotions.  One film by Cameron that doesn't seem to get the same kudos as the films mentioned above is the beautifully crafted, The Abyss(1989).  A more character driven and humanistic film than any of the blockbuster features of James Cameron.  Seeing it in the Special Edition version is the best way because situations and people become filled with more depth.  Low Key epic picture that is driven by the excellent acting of its cast.  Certain scenes like the reviving and ""Bud""'s commuication with aliens moments make the film into an interesting constructed vision of human nature.  In some ways The Abyss(1989) follows some ideas that echos The Day the Earth Stood Still(1950).  Especially true in the film's message about the dangers of nuclear weapons.  Michael Biehn perfects his sterotype persona in The Abyss(1989) as the battle and take charged obsessed Lt. Coffey.  Maybe the finest directed feature film James Cameron has put forth.  The Abyss(1989) is way better than the overrated and less than average Titanic(1997).  Minor weakness is that the film at times drags towards the end.  Ed Harris produces a performance of human depth and quality as Virgil Brigman.

436,Lethal Weapon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4460300/,"If you have to see an action movie or buddy cop movie from the 80s, and you've already seen ""Die Hard"", then you absolutely must see ""Lethal Weapon"". It's one of my all-time favorites, if not my absolute favorite, and everything about is so watchable and memorable, and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. An absolute classic. The film was so influential that it spawned a whole host of copycats, such as ""Red Heat"", ""Tango & Cash"", ""The Glimmer Man"", ""Bad Boys"" its sequels, and others.You already know the plot: Two very different cops (Mel Gibson, Danny Glover) are assigned to work with each other, to take down some drug dealers. Matters are complicated however, when they kidnap one cop's daughter.This movie was perfect, especially for its time period, it still holds up today. The characters are still engaging, everyone delivers wonderful performances, there are great action sequences, and this movie is pretty much the epitome of character development. Amid the bullets and fighting, you get to see two very different characters, who are both in a way, the same character. Both cops have been on the force for a while, both have seen action, both are getting tired and looking for a way out. Both are good cops and people, but Murtaugh is tired of putting his life on the line, which is all Riggs knows how to do. Riggs and Murtaugh are two sides of the same coin, and they are one of the best on-screen duos ever to be seen. BothGibson's character, Martin Riggs, really brings most of the action, and when he's not dodging bullets or beating the crap out of someone, he's joking around and being cocky. Glover's character, Roger Murtaugh, is a skilled cop, but one who's tired of being a cop. Riggs is just tired of living. The two become embroiled in a drug investigation, and the pair engage in many antics along the way, such as a shootout at a Christmas tree lot, a death-defying jump off of a building, an intense chase along Hollywood Boulevard, and one final, brutal, legendary final fight scene that really compliments the tone of the whole film, and it really expresses the intensity and craziness of Riggs.Many refer to this as an action comedy, which is fair, but it really is more generous to the action genre than the comedy genre. There are some comedic moments, but this, and the second film are definitely more action-thriller oriented than comedy-oriented, but 3 and 4 are much more lighthearted. This film barely scrapes by as an action comedy, which is one of the things that makes it so good. It's just really brutally action-packed, probably as much as ""Die Hard"", but not to the point where it's over the top. Probably the perfect mix of action and storytelling, honestly. There were many memorable action scenes, such as the Christmas tree lot shootout, desert shootout, torture fight, club shootout and foot chase, and the final fight. In between those are many other brief instances of action and violence.Shane Black, a truly gifted script writer, has written some excellent films, and this is definitely one of, if not his actual, best. He establishes a really cool, dark, and gritty mood, and it compliments the character of Riggs so well. The film is really about two different, flawed characters who try to do the right thing, and succeed, learning about and accepting each other in the process. I should also note that Gary Busey delivers a pretty great performance as a villain, and he and Jet Li were probably the best of the four villains from the franchise.Richard Donner also delivers incredibly with the action sequences, adeptly staging and pacing the scenes, and swiftly moving us from one nail-biting scene to the next, while also using the lead actors' talents to the fullest, and Donner also handles the dramatic scenes quite well here, proving that he can capably handle just about any scenario he has to direct.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this film, and except for a few brief instances of unnecessary nudity, and a lot of strong language, this film is just too good not to watch, and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot, at least once.",negative,"[['an action', 'movie', 'buddy cop movie', 'Die Hard', 'Lethal Weapon'], ['absolute favorite', 'everything', 'no matter'], ['An absolute classic'], ['The film', 'a whole host', 'Red Heat', 'Tango', 'Cash', 'Glimmer Man', 'Bad Boys', 'the plot', 'Mel Gibson', 'Danny Glover', 'some drug'], ['cop', 'daughter.This movie', 'time', 'period', 'today'], ['everyone', 'great action', 'this movie', 'the epitome', 'character', 'development'], ['fighting', 'a way', 'the same character'], ['the force', 'a while', 'action', 'a way'], ['Murtaugh', 'life', 'the line', 'Riggs'], ['Riggs', 'Murtaugh', 'the same coin', 'on-screen duos'], ['BothGibson', 'character', 'Martin Riggs', 'the action', 'the crap', 'someone'], ['Glover', 'character', 'Roger Murtaugh', 'a skilled cop', 'a cop'], ['Riggs', 'living'], ['become', 'a drug', 'investigation', 'the pair', 'engage', 'the way', 'a shootout', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'lot', 'a death-defying jump', 'a building', 'an intense chase', 'Hollywood Boulevard', 'legendary final fight', 'scene', 'the tone', 'the whole film', 'the intensity', 'craziness', 'Riggs.Many', 'an action', 'comedy', 'the action', 'genre', 'the comedy', 'genre'], ['the second film'], ['This film', 'an action', 'comedy'], ['Die Hard', 'the point'], ['the perfect mix', 'action', 'storytelling'], ['many memorable action', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'lot', 'shootout', 'desert', 'shootout', 'torture', 'fight', 'club', 'shootout', 'foot', 'chase', 'the final fight'], ['action', 'violence.Shane', 'Black', 'gifted script', 'writer'], ['mood', 'the character', 'Riggs'], ['The film', 'the right thing', 'the process'], ['Gary Busey', 'great performance', 'a villain', 'Jet Li', 'the franchise.Richard', 'Donner', 'the action', 'nail-biting scene', 'Donner', 'any scenario', 'this film', 'unnecessary nudity', 'a lot', 'strong language', 'this film', 'a shot']]","[['action movie', 'buddy cop movie', 'Die Hard', 'Lethal Weapon'], ['all-time favorites', 'absolute favorite', 'everything', 'matter', 'many times'], ['absolute classic'], ['film', 'host of copycats', 'Red Heat', 'Tango & Cash', 'Glimmer Man', 'Bad Boys', 'sequels', 'plot', 'different cops', 'Mel Gibson', 'Danny Glover', 'drug dealers'], ['Matters', 'cop', 'daughter.This movie', 'time period', 'today'], ['characters', 'everyone delivers', 'wonderful performances', 'action sequences', 'movie', 'epitome of character development'], ['bullets and fighting', 'different characters', 'way', 'same character'], ['cops', 'force', 'while', 'action', 'way'], ['good cops and people', 'Murtaugh', 'life', 'line', 'Riggs'], ['Riggs and Murtaugh', 'sides', 'same coin', 'on-screen duos'], ['BothGibson', 'character', 'Martin Riggs', 'action', 'dodging bullets', 'crap out of someone'], ['Glover', 'character', 'Roger Murtaugh', 'skilled cop', 'cop'], ['Riggs', 'living'], ['become', 'drug investigation', 'pair engage', 'many antics', 'way', 'shootout', 'Christmas tree lot', 'death-defying jump', 'building', 'chase along Hollywood Boulevard', 'fight scene', 'tone', 'whole film', 'intensity', 'craziness of Riggs.Many', 'action comedy', 'action genre', 'comedy genre'], ['comedic moments', 'second film'], ['film', 'action comedy', 'things'], ['Die Hard', 'point'], ['mix of action', 'storytelling'], ['action scenes', 'Christmas tree lot shootout', 'desert shootout', 'torture fight', 'club shootout', 'foot chase', 'final fight'], ['instances of action', 'violence.Shane Black', 'script writer', 'excellent films'], ['mood', 'character of Riggs'], ['film', 'flawed characters', 'right thing', 'process'], ['Gary Busey', 'great performance', 'villain', 'Jet Li', 'villains', 'franchise.Richard Donner', 'action sequences', 'scenes', 'nail-biting scene', 'lead actors', 'talents', 'Donner', 'dramatic scenes', 'scenario', 'film', 'few brief instances', 'unnecessary nudity', 'lot', 'strong language', 'film', 'shot']]"

439,Blood Simple,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1911618/,"As far as directorial debuts go, few are as ambitious and inventive as the Coen brothers' first film, Blood Simple, as it mixes genres and moods in a way that anticipated Tarantino's similar experiments by a decade, while still retaining an apparent simplicity, both narratively and formally, that few people originally saw as the beginning of one of American cinema's most extraordinary careers.Set in a stark Texas landscape, Blood Simple opens on a premise that seems to be borrowed from the likes of Double Indemnity or The Postman Always Rings Twice: someone steals another man's wife. However, the two adulterous lovers (Jamie Getz and Frances McDormand) do not plan to assassinate the betrayed husband (Dan Hedaya). On the contrary, he hires a sleazy PI (M. Emmett Walsh) to spy on them to carry out some twisted plan of his own. That is, until the investigator goes rogue and the situation escalates in the most grotesque of ways.This escalation is matched by the Coens' constant shifts between genres, achieved through lighting, music and camera movements. Noir, straightforward thriller, horror, black comedy: Blood Simple is each of these and all of them at once, but the transition is never forced or unnatural; in fact, these transitions occur because somehow the story itself demands that they happen. In a way, this is a film that is aware of its own fictitious nature and toys with it as much as possible - because it can. This has since become a trademark of the two brothers, and it is as fresh and original now as it was back in 1984.The same can be said of the four main actors: Getz and McDormand (soon to be Mrs. Joel Coen) form a solid leading couple, thoroughly menaced by the sudden ferocity of Hedaya, then best known for playing Rhea Perlman's dim-witted ex-husband on Cheers (an image he gladly, and expertly, reverses here). And then there's Walsh, who takes his practically identical role in Blade Runner and increases the character's unlikability, turning in one of the most brutally charming villainous performances of the '80s (and of the Coen canon).Joel and Ethan Coen had a very clear idea of what they wanted to achieve in the movie business from the get-go, and Blood Simple is one of the best examples of this: for 90 minutes, it takes you to a whole new world, one that most people are happy to revisit as often as they can.",positive,"[['Coen', 'first film', 'Blood Simple', 'a way', 'Tarantino', 'a decade', 'an apparent simplicity', 'the beginning', 'American', 'cinema', 'extraordinary careers.Set', 'Texas', 'landscape', 'Blood Simple', 'a premise', 'Double Indemnity', 'Postman Always Rings Twice', 'someone', 'another man', 'wife'], ['Jamie Getz', 'Frances McDormand', 'the betrayed husband', 'Dan Hedaya'], ['PI', 'M.

The film is the second installment in the Mad Max film series, with Mel Gibson starring as Max Rockatansky.I grew up with the Mad Max films and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior Is my personal favorite best epic Post-Apocalyptic Action Classic Science Fiction film. I always loved The Road Warrior to death this film stayed in my heart. Fury Road and The Road Warrior are Equal for me so I am ranting them 10 and I always tried to take the first film of the Max series as the best one in the franchise but I couldn't, because it is just too dark is not post apocalyptic film enough, it has Drama between the film and the plot starts slow which becomes really boring. The Road Warrior is the opposite of Mad Max which just stayed in my heart and I just love this movie to death and I always will. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior still remains one of the most exhilarating action films to ever grace the screen. The car chases are as excitingly pulse-pounding as ever and no film has yet to surpass the final chase as the best in movie history. Yes, in terms of pure action, not many films have been able to equal The Road Warrior's thrills.Mel Gibson remains the only world-renowned actor in the whole film. He does a terrific job as the character Max, one of his best and most interesting characters. The development of Max is another intriguing component of The Road Warrior, and serves the film by giving it a human edge by featuring Max's slow transformation from loner to savior. Not only that, Gibson also creates a great action hero. There's not a moment in the film when we aren't rooting for Max to smash Humungus and his gang.The Humungus and Wez for me were the best villains ever in the film. Bruce Spence as the gyro-pilot is decent in his role and offers the film's few humorous moments. And also he has a lot of scenes and a lot of things to do in this film. Like flying that flayer helping Max saving him, fighting against Humungus thugs. Emil Minty as The Feral Kid is awesome. The old man as the narrator from the beginning of the film is The Feral Kid, I love the relationship between him and Max. That's what I love in this film the acting is TERRIFIC from the actors. Virginia Hey as Warrior Woman is beautiful and fantastic in this movie. I seriously loved how she acted towards Max that he isn't trust worthy, he needed to win her trust. I love Max's dog he was so better than in the first movie the other dog was. You could even see a personality in this dog. I love this movie to death and will always be in my heart Forever.

443,The Warriors,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2475269/,"Its seems the trend now days with indie directors and some mainstream to imitate movies of this kind. Movies with stylish direction, big performances and killer lines that are endlessly quotable. I feel some reviews that are negative towards it misunderstand it completely. I've read that its 'silly' and the acting is amateurish. First of all of course it is silly, just look at the outfits of some of the gangs, plain ridiculous but Walter Hill and the makers know that this is not supposed to be reality, its a video game or comic book movie and in the end a damn fine entertaining one at that. I don't see any problem with the acting to be fair and I must say Deborah Van Valkenberg steals your heart by the end. Her character Mercy starts off a trashy, mouthy and easy piece of ass that ditches her current gang the Orphans cos maybe she is looking for some 'real action' so tags onto the Warriors. However as the movie develops, she shows a vulnerable side that she is going nowhere - stuck in a rut, looking for a way out or a better life. The scene when the two young couples get on the subway with their posh clothes and bright smiles and laughter, until they notice Mercy and Swan sat with cuts and bruises, the camera pans to Mercy's dirty feet - she goes to straighten her hair and Swan stops her showing his growing caring for her. Its just brilliant, further emphasising that this is more than just a cult fighting film. None more than the final few reels and the song which includes the lyrics 'somewhere out on that horizon, out beyond the neon lights, I know there must be something better'... etc does the film develop its soul and I believe what makes it genuinely great. For me it has action, good characters, a great soundtrack and an ending that makes me want to weep as the few that survive the night walk along the shoreline.

444,Escape from Alcatraz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3468916/,"Escape from Alcatraz is a 1979 film starring Clint Eastwood, Patrick McGooghan, Roberts Blossom, and Paul Benjamin.Eastwood is Frank Morris, who, with the two Anglin brothers (their names were changed for the film) contrived the most elaborate scheme ever to escape ""The Rock."" Their bodies were never found, and a photo surfaced some years later of the brothers in Brazil. The escape, plus Alcatraz's bad reputation, helped it close less than a year later.The movie gives a good idea of the horrors of prison life, and particularly the horrors of Alcatraz. Frankly, I don't think the escapees cared if they died. I'm sure anything was better than being in Alcatraz. Escape from Alcatraz is old-fashioned in that it has the art of the buildup, something lost in today's scripts. Today you must get to the point of your story in the first ten minutes. A film, for instance, like San Francisco where the earthquake happens toward the end would be a no-no. So we see the preparations, and they're impressive - papier mache heads with hair stolen from the barber shop to fool the guards into thinking they were asleep, digging out a grill at the back of the cell and putting a false grill up to fool the guards; welding a digging tool together with silver from a dime; the making of a raft; playing music while digging to hide the noise (though this really isn't shown). It was painstaking.Patrick McGoohan plays the warden, who, like all film prison wardens, is a horror show. When he sees a portrait of himself in a cell, he takes away the painting privileges of one of the inmates, Doc. When he finds out two inmates are talking cell to cell, he demands that they be separated. Actually, at the time of the escape, the warden was Olin Blackwell, considered the most lenient warden Alcatraz had ever had. And by then, inmates were performing music (shown in the film), and had weekend movies (also shown).Clint Eastwood, heavier than we've seen him in years, does an excellent job as Frank Morris, low-key but lethal. There isn't a tremendous amount of dialogue, but with his great presence and Frank's quiet leadership, we really don't need it.Recommended for a gritty look at life on Alcatraz, and the fascinating escape.",negative,"[['Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'film', 'Clint Eastwood', 'Patrick McGooghan', 'Roberts Blossom', 'Paul Benjamin.Eastwood', 'Frank Morris', 'Anglin', 'the film', 'elaborate scheme', 'Rock'], ['a photo', 'Brazil'], ['The escape', 'Alcatraz', 'bad reputation', 'a year', 'later.The movie', 'a good idea', 'prison', 'life', 'Alcatraz'], ['Frankly'], ['sure anything', 'Alcatraz'], ['Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'the art', 'the buildup', 'something', 'today'], ['Today', 'the point', 'story', 'the first ten'], ['A film', 'instance', 'San Francisco', 'the earthquake', 'the end'], ['papier', 'mache', 'hair', 'the barber', 'shop', 'a grill', 'the back', 'the cell', 'a false grill', 'a digging', 'tool', 'silver', 'a dime', 'the making', 'a raft', 'music', 'the noise'], ['McGoohan', 'the warden', 'all film', 'prison', 'a horror', 'show'], ['a portrait', 'a cell', 'the painting', 'Doc'], ['cell', 'cell'], ['the time', 'the escape', 'the warden', 'Olin Blackwell', 'lenient warden', 'Alcatraz'], ['music', 'the film', 'weekend', '.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'an excellent job', 'Frank Morris'], ['a tremendous amount', 'dialogue', 'great presence', 'Frank', 'quiet leadership', 'a gritty look', 'life', 'Alcatraz', 'the fascinating escape']]","[['Escape from Alcatraz', 'film', 'Clint Eastwood', 'Patrick McGooghan', 'Roberts Blossom', 'Paul Benjamin.Eastwood', 'Frank Morris', 'Anglin brothers', 'names', 'film', 'elaborate scheme', 'Rock'], ['bodies', 'photo', 'years', 'brothers in Brazil'], ['escape', 'Alcatraz', 'bad reputation', 'year', 'later.The movie', 'good idea', 'horrors of prison life', 'horrors of Alcatraz'], ['Frankly', 'escapees'], ['sure anything', 'Alcatraz'], ['Escape from Alcatraz', 'art', 'buildup', 'something', 'today', 'scripts'], ['Today', 'point', 'story', 'ten minutes'], ['film', 'instance', 'San Francisco', 'earthquake', 'end'], ['preparations', 'papier mache heads', 'hair', 'barber shop', 'guards', 'grill', 'back', 'cell', 'false grill', 'guards', 'digging tool', 'silver', 'dime', 'making', 'raft', 'music', 'noise'], ['painstaking.Patrick McGoohan', 'warden', 'film prison wardens', 'horror show'], ['portrait', 'cell', 'painting privileges', 'inmates', 'Doc'], ['inmates', 'cell', 'cell'], ['time', 'escape', 'warden', 'Olin Blackwell', 'warden Alcatraz'], ['inmates', 'music', 'film', 'weekend movies', '.Clint Eastwood', 'years', 'job as Frank Morris'], ['amount of dialogue', 'great presence and Frank', 'quiet leadership', 'look at life', 'Alcatraz', 'fascinating escape']]"

448,Blow-Up,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1036180/,"Is an image really there when you see it in closer zoom-ins? Or does it become even more indistinct, confusing the eye even more? Was there or wasn't there a crime being committed in the middle of the day in a London park? Are there any answers, and is this whole ""mystery"" even worth even investigating? These are questions that are the root of the matter, and Michaelangelo Antonioni toys with what happens, and what doesn't happen, what is, what is not, what is real, and what is unreal. The story, if there truly is one, moves slowly and deliberately: David Hemmings portrays an unsympathetic fashion photographer -- he is credited as Thomas but we never hear him called this way -- who seems to wallow in his own prowess as a photographer. He treats women like mincemeat -- to him, they're only objects for his lust as when he meets Veruschka and practically rapes her through a photo shoot -- or mannequins who can't pose worth anything and only fuel his anger. He also has a painter friend who's girlfriend (Sarah Miles) seems to have a certain interest in him, but whom he ignores, like all other women who come in contact with him. After what turns to be a lousy photo shoot he does some meandering and comes to a park, and from a distance witnesses a woman and a man (Vanessa Redgrave and Ronan O'Casey), in an apparent, romantic interlude, enjoying the day and the semi-privacy within the park's confines. He takes pictures, walks closer, takes more pictures, walks even closer... almost predatory so, much like a voyeur.That is, until she sees him and demands he return to her the film roll -- he can't take pictures just like that, and is against her consent. He declines so and gives her a different film (after almost having her beg for it). And a little after halfway through the story, he develops his film... and sees what looks to be like a body on the ground, the outline of a man with a gun hidden within some thick bushes. And her reaction, full of angry surprise.Has he truly photographed a murder in progress? Is he privy to more than he should be, and could this have some danger in store for him? Antonioni toys with the audience, never letting in on Redgrave's character, but letting us experience the world through Hemmings untrustworthy eyes and superficial values that momentarily seem to have been thrown out of whack due to this disquieting incident. The problem is, what Hemmings sees may or may not be true -- a classic shot where he tries to find Redgrave and he sees her in the middle of a walking crowd and she literally makes an about-face and disappears from view. Just like that. And his grasp of the mystery emanating from his brush with her at the park, like even Hemmings at the end, is gone, dissolved into the grass.This is not a film for people looking for action and adventure as quite the opposite happens here. It's a film that echoes the French New Wave as it tells a story about an antihero who has a moment of crisis and decides to (maybe) take action, and is left suspended at the end.

449,Blow-Up,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092512/,"Antonioni's Blow-Up was the biggest hit of the Italian director's career, the superficial elements of the fashion world, Swinging London and orgies on purple paper ensuring its commercial success.Models such as Veruschka (who appears in the film), Twiggy and fashion photographers at the time have complained about its unrealistic depiction of the industry and claimed that its central character, Thomas (played by the late David Hemmings) was clearly based on David Bailey.To look at Blow-Up as an analysis of the fashion business in the Sixties is to misunderstand the film's intentions. In any case, when watching this film it may be difficult to tell what its all about if you're unfamiliar with Antonioni's films but it obviously has little to do with the fashion world which is merely the setting for the story and nothing more.Antonioni made the clearest statement of his motivation as a filmmaker at the end of Beyond the Clouds when he talked about his belief that reality is unattainable as it is submerged by layers of images which are only versions of reality.This is a rather pretentious way of saying that everyone perceives reality in their own way and ultimately see only what they want to see.With this philosophy in mind, Blow-Up is probably Antonioni's most personal film.Thomas' hollow, self-obsessed world is shattered when he discovers that he may have photographed a murder when casually taking pictures in a park. He encounters a mysterious woman, Jane (Vanessa Redgrave) who demands he hand over the film and when he refuses she appears at his studio, although Thomas never told her his address.When the evidence disappears shortly afterwards, Blow-Up seems to deal in riddles that have no solution. Redgrave re-appears and then vanishes before the photographer's eyes, Thomas returns to the park without his camera and sees the body. The film concludes with Thomas, having discovered the body has disappeared, watching a group of mimes playing tennis without a ball or rackets in the park where the murder may have taken place.It is only in the final scene of the film where the riddle is solved. Thomas throws the imaginary ball back into the court and watches the game resume. The look of realisation on his face is all too apparent as the game CAN BE HEARD taking place out of shot.There is a ball, there are rackets and this is a real game of tennis. What we have seen up until this point is the photographer's perception of reality: the murder, the mysterious woman in the park, the photographic evidence and the body.The following exchange between Hemmings and Redgrave is the key to the film:Thomas: Don't let's spoil everything, we've only just met.Jane: No, we haven't met.

470,The Conjuring,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827912/,"*Short Synopsis* We all know by now that this movie is based on true events. The film advertised how the family of the house kept quiet about the incidents for over 30 years because the public couldn't handle what happened. The movie is set in the 1970s when the family of a farmhouse begins experiencing paranormal events. The real life paranormal investigators Ed and Loraine Warren are called in to make sense of what is going on. Then the events become more intense and violent until the climatic conclusion. This may sound like another typical ghost house plot, but this movie was so much more. I personally love James Wans work in the horror genre. I loved the original Saw, directed by him, and even some of the sequels which were not directed by him. I loved the intensely creepy movie ""Dead Silence"". I even liked his attempt at the thriller revenge film with ""Death Sentence"". Then he made a big comeback in the horror genre with the landmark film ""Insidious"" which terrified many, and made many think it was pretentious. The film was written by his friend Leigh Whannell, who also wrote and starred in Saw. It was polarized with great reviews and some negative reviews. But most great horror movies go through that type of reaction at the time of its release. Now it is considered a modern classic in the genre. It even has a sequel ""Insidious Chapter 2"" which is directed by Wan and again written by Whannell, so that seems legit! But before Insidious 2, James was rumored to direct another Horror movie. So then I began anticipating James Wans next movie. I heard about ""The Conjuring"" being in production, but that it wasn't being written by Whannell. I was slightly less interested at that point. Then the first teaser trailer came out. It was the perfect build up of tension similar to that of ""Insidious"" and some classic horror movies I will mention later. I wanted to see this movie. The official full length trailers were nice and creepy too. Now onto the review. Not only is this a great horror movie, but it is a great movie in general. Many have compared parts of the film to ""The Amityville Horror"". Some have said it like it is a bad thing. But you have to remember that the investigators of this movie also investigated the real life Amityville house. The similarities are a nice touch in my opinion. But honestly, this movie makes Amityville look like a Disney movie. The characters in the movie are REAL. They make you care for them. You start to feel like these people are friends of yours or distant relatives while watching the movie. When things start to happen to them at night, you feel like you are experiencing it with them. This is something that is hard for a horror movie to do. Usually you just want to see the scary stuff happen to the people and watch certain characters die. The actors and actresses all do a wonderful and believable job. The music is very unsettling in a great horror movie way. This movie made me feel like a kid again being scared of the 'unknown' entities in the dark. Those are still creepy thoughts even as a grown up after watching a movie like this. There is creepy tension echoed throughout the film. The movie also manages to have some of the scariest images seen. When the apparitions finally reveal themselves, I started to cover my eyes like a child. There is something about the way James Wan directs these images. An image of an old woman ghost slowly floating over you. You have to see it to know exactly what I'm talking about. I honestly jumped in terror more than a few times. Something that rarely happens for me. There is even the typical James Wan aspect of the film featuring evil dolls. The first part of the movie has a lot of build up and some rather jumpy scary scenes. The final part of the movie is very intense with its scare value without turning into another mindless horror movie. Don't take your eyes off the screen or you'll miss some of the more subtle and creepy scary moments. There are seriously moments that will definitely keep children and some adults up at night. There is a perfectly set up scene involving a maid that is proof you can scare an audience without cutting someone up. This movie will remind you of Insidious too with its style of directing, but this movie is also more of a traditional movie with many elements of horror. But honestly, this movie surpassed Insidious greatly with its scare value. This is undeniably James Wans best movie to date. This film can go on great horror movie lists along side ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", and ""A Nightmare On Elmstreet"" etc. I can see this movie becoming a hit at the box office as well.

471,The Conjuring,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2834768/,"I'm an avid horror fan. Lately I've been thinking there isn't much that can scare me (though Sinister got under my skin). I appreciate James Wan's films, I love the first Saw, Insidious was a damn good modern ghost story, but like all reviews have stated for it, the movie kinda loses it's momentum in the final act.The Conjuring is better, scarier, and more tense than Insidious. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's one of the best horror movies of the last 5 or 10 years. It goes back to the classic rule of horror film making, never show the bad guy fully to your audience. Plus this movie knows suspense, I tell you, I almost threw a water bottle at the screen from sheer terror once the scare finally happened. There are no fake jump scares, the movie earned an R rating without any blood, sex, or profanity, it's all from the terror that this movie builds upon.Not only is the movie scary, but as a film itself, it's almost a masterpiece. The script, acting, direction, style, tone, etc were all simply top notch. Wan's camera-work here is by far his best out of any of his movies. The choice to set the movie in the 70s was a stroke of genius as it feels so authentic and all the more real. If this story were set in the present, it simply wouldn't be as a effective or scary. The 70s style film making, costuming, and hair styling are a great throwback to likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror.Though there are a few (extremely minor) flaws, such are length, repetitiveness, and a resolution that happens way too fast. I don't care, every horror movie (or movie in general) has it's flaws. There will never be a perfect horror movie, if there is one, I haven't seen it yet. But all I know is James Wan's The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and it's been a really long time that a movie has scared me this badly.10/10 Don't miss this one, it's an amazing theater viewing experience.",positive,"[['an avid horror', 'fan'], ['Sinister', 'skin'], ['James Wan', 'Saw', 'Insidious', 'a damn', 'good modern ghost', 'story', 'the movie', 'kinda', 'momentum', 'the final act.The', 'Conjuring', 'tense', 'Insidious'], ['a limb', 'horror'], ['the classic rule', 'horror', 'film', 'making', 'the bad guy', 'audience'], ['this movie', 'suspense', 'a water', 'bottle', 'the screen', 'sheer', 'terror', 'the scare'], ['no fake jump', 'the movie', 'an R', 'rating', 'any blood', 'sex', 'profanity', 'the terror', 'this movie', 'the movie', 'a film', 'a masterpiece'], ['The script', 'direction', 'style', 'tone', 'top notch'], ['Wan', 'camera-work'], ['The choice', 'the movie', 'a stroke', 'genius'], ['this story'], ['style', 'film', 'making', 'costuming', 'hair', 'styling', 'a great throwback', 'Exorcist', 'Amityville Horror.Though', 'repetitiveness', 'a resolution', 'way'], ['every horror', 'movie', 'movie'], ['a perfect horror', 'movie'], ['James Wan', 'Conjuring', 'horror', 'a long time', 'long time', 'a movie', 'this badly.10/10', 'an amazing theater', 'experience']]","[['horror fan'], ['Sinister', 'skin'], ['James Wan', 'films', 'first Saw', 'Insidious', 'damn', 'ghost story', 'reviews', 'movie kinda', 'momentum', 'act.The Conjuring', 'tense than Insidious'], ['limb', 'horror movies', 'years'], ['rule of horror film making', 'bad guy', 'audience'], ['movie', 'suspense', 'water bottle', 'screen from sheer terror', 'scare'], ['jump scares', 'movie', 'R rating', 'blood', 'sex', 'profanity', 'terror', 'movie', 'movie', 'film', 'masterpiece'], ['script', 'direction', 'style', 'tone', 'top notch'], ['Wan', 'camera-work', 'movies'], ['choice', 'movie', 'stroke of genius'], ['story'], ['style film making', 'costuming', 'hair styling', 'great throwback', 'likes', 'Exorcist', 'Amityville Horror.Though', 'flaws', 'repetitiveness', 'resolution', 'way'], ['horror movie', 'movie', 'flaws'], ['horror movie'], ['James Wan', 'Conjuring', 'horror movies', 'long time', 'long time', 'movie', 'badly.10/10', 'amazing theater', 'experience']]"
472,Disconnect,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2782504/,"This movie has three parallel stories, with one important thing in common: real lives unravel as their presence on the media, especially the social media, spirals out of control. Moreover, as it turns out, each story ends up intersecting with one or both of the others.There is Ben, a lonely teen who is hideously deceived and then callously exposed on the Web by two mean-spirited schoolmates. This drives Ben to make a grave decision that will leave his future hanging by a thread and his parents and sister reeling.Then there are Cindy and Derek, who are trying to grapple with the death of their baby. As if that weren't enough of an issue in their life, they discover their credit cards have been maxed out. The private eye they hire, Mike, backtracks Cindy's and Derek's every online move, with unexpected revelations. Moreover, the result of Mike's investigation turns out to compound the problem rather than solve it.Finally, there is Nina, an up-and-coming TV news reporter who gets her hands on the life story of Kyle, an older teen engaging in a salacious line of work performed online in front of a camera. Nina's TV piece is at first widely applauded, but its broadcast unleashes an avalanche of trouble for both Nina and Kyle, as well as for other people in their career lives.A ready interpretation of the title ""Disconnect"" is to associate it with the dangers of ""disconnecting"" with real people in the real world. And indeed: people in this movie do communicate a lot via text messaging, and in chat rooms. In these spheres, things are sometimes not what they seem—and neither are people: two characters make up another, and communicate with someone else pretending to be that person, with potentially lethal consequences.But the title ""Disconnect"" can also be taken as an imperative: ""Disconnect!"" Log off already! Otherwise, you will forget real existences cannot be edited, backed up, deleted, and restored like virtual ones. Actually, real life in this movie interferes with virtual plots in a way that even the latter take unintended twists and turns.It turns out Mike not only changes Cindy and Derek's life (they set out to make a dramatic move as a result of Mike's investigations), he also is forcibly involved in the story around Ben. Ben's dad, in turn, is a legal counsel at the TV station where Nina works; that way, he is drawn on two fronts into the fallout from risky behavior of teens on the Internet.While this is Nina's immediate connection to another story in this movie, the mere fact that she is a TV personality probably superimposes her story on the others: just as everybody is online these days, everybody still consumes sensational TV news. (Need it even be said: when you turn on your TV, you also ""disconnect"" from real life.)The three stories progress at a similar pace and climax at the same time. After all the scheming, searching, plotting, and just plain misunderstanding emanating from cell phones and computer keyboards, the scenes suddenly stop in freeze-frame.

How a movie like this can be made without a ton of money being exchanged between the writers of the original work and the plagiarists who reconstituted a couple of old script's is beyond me? This movie simply combined the plots of two previous made Hollywood movies entitled ""Heat"" and ""Point Break"", packaged it in a different city, Boston instead of Los Angeles, and added the dreadful acting and directing of Ben Affleck. I just wish I could get my money back for having paid for this awful movie. After all, I've already see ""Heat"" and ""Point Break"" dozens of times and like them both. I'm not going to rehash the storyline but I do want to point out a few things that particularly annoyed me about this movie. The first is the part is the rip from ""Shawshank Redemption"" where she dug up the bag of money. This scene worked so magnificently in Shawshank because you desperately wanted the characters to end up in Zihuatanejo as free men. When the female character in ""The Town"" dug up the bag, I was hoping she would give it to the authorities so they could expedite the process of tracking down the thug murderer who buried it there and throw him in the electric chair. In other words, I didn't find any of characters sympathetic, compelling or likable. Second, are we really supposed to believe a successful, single, very good looking woman would fall for an uneducated, ruthless killer thug from Southie? Really? Finally, in this day and age of ""CSI"" and ""BONES"", are we supposed to believe Affleck's character is just going to lay low in Florida for the rest of his life? That final scene was almost as ridiculous as the part where he was working out. What was that? Was that some sort of dare between he and his Hollywood buddies to have a comparatively and equally lame scene like the one in ""Top Gun"" when they are playing volleyball?

485,Munich,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1258104/,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?"" At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything"" Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls.

487,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1218542/,"Directed and co-written by Shane Black; based on a novel, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"" written by Brett Halliday; and starring Robert Downey Jnr, Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan.A terrific opening credit sequence easily sets up the audacity and chagrin of the film for an appreciative audience. In essence, these are the reasons why you need to see this movie: the razor sharp wit, shockingly fast-paced and hysterical dialogue, pulp-fiction-esquire vibe, its pure cheesiness and the cynicism of a beat up old paperback detective novel. Got you yet? Alright, maybe an explanation of the seemingly simple plot is warranted. It begins with a ridiculously funny set up resulting in Downey's character being paired up with Kilmer to observe the latter in his job as a private detective. They hook up with a down-on-her luck actress who brings a case for the sleuths. This synopsis constitutes gross misrepresentation on my part as things get remarkably complex. How so? Well, even the lead the character (who also is purposefully pathetic as narrator) takes time out within the movie to remember where he is in telling the story. There are even snippets of dialogue where the characters attempt to fill in the gaps or actually remind themselves of what has happened thus far in the movie. Downey, Kilmer and Monaghan are all caricatures drawn from popular references of literature, movies and art. All however, are larger than life, exhibit great chemistry and for a movie buff, it is heaven to witness the self referential exercises and hear the narrator shred every narrating convention applicable. Downey's performance is remarkable (neurotic, comic, vulnerable and charming). I have never seen Kilmer in such a well-defined, uproarious piece of work. Monaghan is also integral to the trio and shines exuding a brash, fighting and sexy appeal. She brought back fond memories of early Kathleen Turner and Rene Russo. The fact that her look screams Renee Zellweger, is not a bad thing either. Black became famous in the 1980s for writing the hit buddy movies: Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight. As a first time director, he does well keeping the frenetic pace and allowing the audience to catch up only to get lost time and time again. The style is so disarmingly effective, that at times I shook my head in confusion or found my hands against my mouth, agape in shock. I also think that in creating such a brilliant script that Black may have blacklisted himself in Hollywood for mirroring its supposed fame and glamor and exposing its not too pretty side. His one-liners and connected sub-plots are not typical and Kilmer and Downey make magic with their banter and clinical delivery. All the ingredients of a pulp-noir novella can be found, even employing a structure of chapter-type headings within the movie. Parallel story lines unfold and given plot assumptions are turned over, always with achingly funny results. Even the clichés are clever e.g. a tough guy predictably crashes through a glass table, or body after body turns up, to haunt the characters.I strongly recommend the movie, given the talent of Downey and Kilmer. Downey should be honored with a Lead Actor Oscar nomination; while Kilmer deserves a Supporting Actor nod. It thrilled me to see them both in their element, as I was on the verge of disavowing them as marquee/box-office draws. The screenplay should also attract Oscar consideration.

488,Collateral,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0926659/,"Michael Mann successfully directed 'The Insider,' 'Manhunter,' and the 'Miami Vice' TV series. Tom Cruise's work in 'Magnolia, ' 'Minority Report,' and 'Vanilla Sky' shows his interest in stretching his acting experiences. Not surprisingly, then, their 'Collateral' can be placed next to 'Manchurian Candidate' and 'Bourne Supremacy' for best of the 2004 thriller race.'Collateral' is as slick and tricky as you'd expect from director Mann, whose Hannibal Lecter 'Manhunter,' with great acting by William Petersen and Brian Cox, is a classic of the serial-killer/disturbed cop genre. In 'Collateral' Mann has a special interest in character development with Cruise playing a gray-haired hired assassin and Jamie Foxx a hapless but humane LA cabbie forcibly hired to chauffeur Cruise on a string of hits over the course of one night. Cruise is cold and barely vulnerable as the night moves on; Foxx slowly learns how to grow from the ordeal, even finding potential love from a fare prior to Cruise. Unlikely as they may seem, the two are my nominees for best buddy team of the year, far and away smarter and more amusing than Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in 'Starsky and Hutch.'Part of the insightful screenplay by Stuart Beattie ('Pirates of the Caribbean') is the interplay that lets Cruise's Vincent helpfully assess Max's (Foxx) aspirations to run a limo business when he's been at the preparation for a futile dozen years. Similarly, Max leads Vincent into a discussion of life's meaning, specifically the insignificance of human lives, a topic of some interest to a hit man. The language is taut and minimalist, just right for an evening of clandestine contract murder. When Max comments about one of the hits, 'You just met him once and you killed him like that?' Vincent replies, 'What? I should only kill people after I get to know them.' The bard also made murder a literate topic when his Hamlet said, 'For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak/With most miraculous organ.' The film is not miraculous, but it speaks engagingly.One of the victims involves the two leads in a jazz club, where Vincent shows his considerable knowledge of the music and heartlessness for his victim.

489,Collateral,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1028432/,"Collateral is a masterpiece of American cinema. Jamie Foxx is Max, a Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of his own limo company, ""Island Limo"". After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.His worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Max hasn't even begun to revel in the pleasure of possessing the beautiful attorney's digits when he gets his next passenger, Tom Cruise as Vincent, a slick hit-man in town for a night of killing.When a body drops out of a fourth story window and onto Max's cab, he becomes an unwilling partner on Vincent's murder spree. Director Michael Mann (The Insider, Ali) does a masterful job manipulating texture and tone throughout the movie, taking us to settings as diverse as a junkie's apartment, a penthouse, a hospital room, and a smoky jazz club, all the while making the city of angels a central character in the story.The soundtrack is also excellent, with a mixture of popular music and ambient tracks perfectly-timed and synced to the story... tribal drumbeats during the chase scenes, haunting rock ballads at pivotal moments, and one track that reminded this viewer of the scene at the other end of Tom Cruise's career, when he drives his father's Porsche out of the garage in ""Risky Business"" to the accompaniment of a thumping synth track. A bizarre side-note, I know.As the movie builds to a climax, the police are hunting for Max, believing he is the one on a killing spree, and Vincent stalks his final victim in a blacked-out high-rise office to a backdrop of the brilliant LA skyline, reflected in multiplicity by the office's dozens of glass cubicles.Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith all rise to the occasion in Collateral, and together they transcend their previous appearances on film. Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.There are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.Troy Dayton",positive,"[['Collateral', 'a masterpiece', 'American cinema'], ['Jamie Foxx', 'Max', 'Los Angeles', 'cab', 'driver', 'own limo', 'company', 'Island Limo'], ['the job', 'a glance', 'State Attorney', 'Jada Pinkett Smith', 'phone', 'number'], ['Max', 'the pleasure', 'the beautiful attorney', 'next passenger', 'Tom Cruise', 'Vincent', 'a slick hit-man', 'town', 'a night', 'killing.When', 'a body', 'a fourth story', 'window', 'Max', 'cab', 'an unwilling partner', 'Vincent', 'murder', 'spree'], ['Director Michael Mann', 'Insider', 'Ali', 'a masterful job', 'texture', 'tone', 'the movie', 'a junkie', 'apartment', 'a penthouse', 'a hospital', 'room', 'a smoky jazz', 'club', 'the while', 'the city', 'a central character', 'the story.The', 'soundtrack', 'a mixture', 'popular music', 'ambient', 'the story', 'the chase', 'rock', 'track', 'this viewer', 'the scene', 'the other end', 'Tom Cruise', 'career', 'father', 'Porsche', 'the garage', 'Risky Business', 'the accompaniment', 'synth track'], ['A bizarre side-note', 'the movie', 'a climax', 'the police', 'Max', 'the one', 'a killing spree', 'Vincent', 'final victim', 'a blacked-out high-rise', 'office', 'a backdrop', 'LA', 'skyline', 'multiplicity', 'the office', 'glass', 'cubicles.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Jada Pinkett Smith', 'all rise', 'the occasion', 'Collateral', 'film'], ['Mark Ruffalo', 'a good performance', 'the cop', 'everything', 'a few minor plot', 'disbelief', 'Max', 'Vincent', 'the vicious hit-man', 'Mother', 'the hospital', 'a fantastic movie.Troy', 'Dayton']]","[['Collateral', 'masterpiece', 'American cinema'], ['Jamie Foxx', 'Max', 'Los Angeles cab driver', 'dreams', 'limo company', 'Island Limo'], ['years', 'job', 'intimate details', 'passengers', 'lives', 'glance', 'clothes', 'insight manages', 'defenses', 'passengers', 'State Attorney', 'Jada Pinkett Smith', 'phone number'], ['Max', 'pleasure', 'beautiful attorney', 'digits', 'next passenger', 'Tom Cruise', 'Vincent', 'hit-man in town', 'night of killing.When', 'body', 'story window', 'Max', 'cab', 'partner on Vincent', 'murder spree'], ['Director Michael Mann', 'Insider', 'Ali', 'masterful job', 'texture and tone', 'movie', 'settings', 'junkie', 'apartment', 'penthouse', 'hospital room', 'jazz club', 'while', 'city of angels', 'central character', 'story.The soundtrack', 'mixture', 'popular music', 'ambient tracks', 'story', 'tribal drumbeats', 'chase scenes', 'rock ballads', 'pivotal moments', 'track', 'viewer', 'scene', 'end of Tom Cruise', 'career', 'father', 'Porsche', 'garage', 'Risky Business', 'accompaniment', 'synth track'], ['bizarre side-note', 'movie', 'climax', 'police', 'Max', 'one', 'killing spree', 'Vincent', 'final victim', 'high-rise office', 'backdrop', 'LA skyline', 'multiplicity', 'office', 'dozens of glass cubicles.Tom Cruise', 'Jamie Foxx', 'Jada Pinkett Smith', 'rise', 'occasion in Collateral', 'appearances on film'], ['Mark Ruffalo', 'good performance', 'cop', 'everything', 'plot points', 'disbelief', 'Max', 'Vincent', 'vicious hit-man', 'Mother', 'hospital', 'movie.Troy Dayton']]"

491,Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0577028/,"Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai   * * * * Stars Forest Whitaker stars in this amazingly good character driven film. Whitaker is Ghost Dog, a New York hitman who lives by the code of the ancient samurai. When a job for the mob goes wrong they decide to cut their losses and put a hit out on him. But since he's a samurai and not just a normal hitman this proves to be a huge mistake for them. This film really works on three levels. First is the duality of the film's coolness factor and the strength of Whitaker's performance. Whitaker radiates cool in this film. In every scene and every frame, through both action and inaction we know he is being of awesome power. His performance is note perfect. There's one scene where a grievous wrong has been done and we see Whitaker absorb the devastation, then he narrates that when a making decision it should be done in the space of seven breathes. Once that decision is made and we realize Whitaker's full fury will now be unleashed upon his enemies, it sends a tingle up the spine of the viewer. Whitaker's resolve shines through the screen and through his subsequent acting the pace builds until we reach the film's ultimate battle, which is a really, really good fight scene-one of the most satisfying ever filmed.Furthermore we have the film's philosophy. This aspect of the film is the most important of all even more so than Whitaker's superb performance. As the film's tale unfolds we do need learn about the Way of the Samurai through the eastern philosophy Whitaker espouses as he narrates the film. Often times the film breaks from the action just to linger on the narration and let in sink in. It's a technique that helps set the tone of the film and makes it a completely absorbing experience. The third thing that the film does really well is it is character and not plot driven. At least just as much time is spent following Whitaker through his day to day life as he interacts with people in his community as is spent on the action parts of the plot. In many ways the film works as commentary on the values of modern society. The scenes with Whitaker and his best friend, a Haitian ice cream vendor provide this film with true heart and soul. We see repeatedly that the two friends can understand each other because they are at peace with the world and in tune with their surroundings, so that their bond transcends mere language. Ghost Dog also has a touching relationship with a young girl that he hopes to impart his code to so that she may one day have the tools of knowledge necessary to escape life in the inner city. These are characters that would have been interesting a two-hour film just living their lives without the samurai and hitman aspects of the film. However both aspects work exceptionally well, the effect taken as a whole make this one of the best films of the past few years.Besides Whitaker and his friends, one other great performance is given by Tricia Vessey as Louise Vargo, the young girl that sets all that happens in motion. It's a small part but a key one that she does an admirable job with.If there is a flaw with this film it is that the gangster villains are unnecessarily racist. These scenes are somewhat jarring on first viewing, but are at least consistent with the film's ultimate tone that the gangster's way of life is dying, while the code of the samurai is timeless. It is no coincidence that all the mobsters are much older than Whitaker. Both characters note numerous times that the world is changing, the difference is the gangsters say it with fear and trepidation, while Whitaker notices it as observation. Like the changing of the wind the changing of time and circumstance is neither good nor bad when weighed against his code.While Whitaker deserves infinite praise for his performance, almost just as much praise must be given to director Jim Jarmush. His directing of this film is quite daring and even more skillfull. His approach to the narration is unusual and yet it works on multiple levels and lets us this is a film more about tone than action. The character driven film is a rare commodity. Most films are plot driven moving from point A to point B with no more creativity than a child connecting a dot-to-dot. Here we have a film that starts with its characters and lets them live the lives they've always lived before the central plot elements invaded their existence. The plot is addressed in a timely enough manner, but we see the characters have their own commitments to fulfill too. It's a hard trick to make a character driven film really work without seeming disjointed or slowly paced but Jarmush succeeds masterfully. Jarmush also fills the film with other references in the background that emphasize the character's natures-such as book on bears or the dialogue of a few cartoons here and there. Many films of try to do this, but few films I have ever seen do it as well as Ghost Dog does.A final note, the ending of this film that is one that will be very divisive. People will either love it or hate, personally I loved it. It is an ending that is true to all that his come before for both the characters and their conflicting codes but also one that is both surprising despite being adequately

492,Following,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1610307/,"Christopher Nolan had his goals set on Following in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little 'poverty-row' movies the likes of Ullmer directed back in the 40s. Only this time, he's able to implement touches of homage- things like black and white photography (a given due to the shoe-string budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit) and casting of the actors (the John Doe lead, the slick male counterpart, and the beautiful-in-a-gritty way femme fatale)- while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible. That, and as well in the film-noir mood Nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot, maybe even more so than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch, here the non-linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like Bill can go through as dark a path as Cobb, only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games Cobb is.Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story, and going into it I wasn't even sure where it would lead, if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala Slacker where Nolan would lead his character along to one urban British person to another. But the establishment of the ties of Bill to Cobb are done in a quick and excellent way, as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the café to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both- that, and the first robbery he brings him along for. What seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set-up by Cobb and his lady (just called 'The Blonde', maybe a too-obvious homage to noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing, as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how. The density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his 'deep' ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary, and Theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this; Russell almost makes it too easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage shaking her head.Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman, keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense, with the fade-in/fade-outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the 'this-could-lead-anywhere' logic of the script. He follows it in hand-held form as if he knows where his limitations lie, and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials: close-ups when need be (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror), and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in 'present-day' and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of low-level criminals with mind-games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear, which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way. Simply put, this is one of the great calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years, and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to to discovering. Or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid-editing and big-gun-firing dogs of the mainstream (even in independent films) it's a bright little 71 minutes.",negative,"[['Christopher Nolan', 'narrow direction', 'that direction', 'something', 'the kind', 'Ullmer'], ['this time', 'white photography', 'the shoe-string budget', 'the dark', 'casting', 'John Doe', 'lead', 'the slick male counterpart', 'the beautiful-in-a-gritty way', 'femme fatale', 'the realm', 'underground', 'indie', 'music', 'such anything'], ['the film-noir mood', 'Nolan', 'a cunning', 'web', 'a plot', 'Memento'], ['the latter', 'a work', 'a psychology', 'way', 'a plot', 'the past inch', 'inch', 'the non-linear structure', 'the purpose', 'someone', 'Bill', 'dark', 'a path', 'Cobb', 'an environment', 'someone', 'mind', 'Cobb', 'is.Of', 'course', 'the whole act', 'someone', 'the main thrust', 'the story', 'some kind', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'ala', 'Slacker', 'Nolan', 'character', 'urban British person'], ['the establishment', 'Bill', 'Cobb', 'excellent way', 'Cobb', 'Bill', 'the café', 'both-', 'the first robbery'], ['a good score', 'the horizon', 'big set-up', 'Cobb', 'lady', 'Blonde', 'a too-obvious homage', 'carp'], ['a way', 'the manipulation'], ['The density', 'Alex Haw', 'a true sociopath', ""'deep"", 'pleasure', 'a burglary', 'Theobald', 'that demeanor', 'someone', 'that naive way', 'no chance', 'the dank', 'environment', 'Russell', 'a face', 'Ana Savage', 'head.Meanwhile', 'Nolan', 'the ball', 'style', 'a cameraman', 'nothing', 'a lasting impression', 'logic', 'the script'], ['hand-held form', 'need', 'Russell', 'face', 'a small mirror', 'simple techno', 'track'], ['the line', 'something', 'something', 'a solid pulp', 'story', 'moral ambiguity', 'dark way'], ['Simply', 'a filmmaker', 'something', 'Nolan', 'other work'], ['noir', 'the mainstream']]","[['Christopher Nolan', 'goals', 'narrow direction', 'direction', 'something', 'kind', 'movies', 'likes of Ullmer'], ['time', 'touches', 'homage- things', 'white photography', 'shoe-string budget', 'dark', 'characters', 'casting', 'actors', 'John Doe lead', 'slick male counterpart', 'beautiful-in-a-gritty way', 'femme fatale', 'realm', 'underground indie', 'dollars', 'choices in locations', 'music', 'such anything'], ['mood Nolan', 'cunning web', 'plot', 'Memento'], ['latter', 'work', 'psychology', 'way', 'plot', 'inch by inch', 'non-linear structure', 'purpose', 'someone like Bill', 'dark', 'path as Cobb', 'environment', 'toes', 'someone', 'mind games Cobb is.Of course', 'whole act', 'someone', 'main thrust', 'story', 'kind of stream', 'consciousness ala Slacker', 'Nolan', 'character', 'urban British person'], ['establishment', 'ties of Bill', 'Cobb', 'excellent way', 'Cobb', 'Bill', 'café', 'both-', 'first robbery'], ['good score', 'horizon', 'set-up by Cobb', 'lady', 'Blonde', 'too-obvious homage', 'carp'], ['way', 'manipulation', 'questions'], ['density', 'actors', 'points as characters', 'Alex Haw', 'true sociopath', ""'deep"", 'ideas', 'pleasure', 'burglary', 'Theobald', 'demeanor of someone', 'naive way', 'chance', 'dank environment', 'Russell', 'face', 'Ana Savage', 'head.Meanwhile', 'Nolan', 'ball', 'style', 'cameraman', 'nothing', 'fade-in/fade-outs', 'lasting impression', 'logic', 'script'], ['hand-held form', 'limitations', 'essentials', 'close-ups', 'need', 'Russell', 'face', 'small mirror', 'techno track'], ['line', 'something', 'something', 'pulp story', 'criminals with mind-games', 'moral ambiguity', 'dark way'], ['Simply', 'cards', 'filmmaker', 'recent years', 'something', 'fans of Nolan', 'other work'], ['noir', 'big-gun-firing dogs', 'mainstream', 'independent films', 'minutes']]"
493,Following,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0552015/,"Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.
For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films (this, the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman.This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising.

494,A Simple Plan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4907446/,"Two brothers & a friend from a small town in Minnesota (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Brent Briscoe) happen upon a crashed plane in the woods, which contains over $4 million in cash. They assume it's drug money and hatch a simple plan to sit on the money until spring when the plane is discovered; if no one legitimately claims it they'll divvy it up. But things don't go according to plan due to idiocy, mistrust and greed. Bridget Fonda is on hand as the main protagonist's wife.Directed by Sam Raimi before his ultra-success with the Spider-Man trilogy, ""A Simple Plan"" (1998) was written by Scott B. Smith based on his page-turning book of the same name (there are enough changes to make both worthwhile). The wintery Minnesota setting is fitting for the bleak psychological drama. Speaking of which, the best thing about this movie is its exploration of human nature and how ""the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil,"" as the Bible puts it.The movie effectively shows how basically good and normal people can be corrupted by the temptation of easy wealth; so corrupted that he or she is suddenly willing to murder, lie and connive. The story works so well because of the three well-defined characters. We've all met these types in real life: The wholesome, educated man who's not quite living up to his potential and yet is generally satisfied; the loser, screw-up who's never been with a girl even though he's in his 40s; and the annoying redneck hick.The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Minnesota (Delano, St. Paul & Golden Valley) and Wisconsin (Ashland).GRADE: A-",negative,"[['a friend', 'a small town', 'Minnesota', 'Bill Paxton', 'Billy Bob Thornton', 'Brent Briscoe', 'a crashed plane', 'cash'], ['drug', 'money', 'a simple plan', 'the money', 'spring', 'the plane', 'no one'], ['plan', 'mistrust', 'greed'], ['Bridget Fonda', 'hand', 'the main protagonist', 'Sam Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'trilogy', 'A Simple Plan', 'Scott B.

496,Jackie Brown,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0422043/,"Quentin Tarantino is clearly finding it difficult to follow the phenomenal success of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", which made him the hottest writer-director of his generation.  In the six years since then this is the only time that he has returned to the directors chair.  ""Jackie Brown"" - his ""difficult third film"" - seems to be his response to criticism of his first two films that he could only make movies about other movies, but not real life.  He cleverly anticipates the backlash by adapting a tightly plotted, character driven Elmore Leonard novel, still set in his familiar world of LA low-lives, but keeping to a minimum his trademark comic-book violence and pop-culture references, while emphasising the novels more mature themes - such as ageing and the feeling of time running out for the middle-aged characters.  The result is a slick, interesting, if slightly draggy thriller, which ultimately lacks the freshness and audaciousness of those earlier films.Tarantino still has his maverick streak though, as displayed in his trusting of Pam Grier to carry the entire movie.  The casting of a middle-aged black actress with no box-office clout in the lead role can't have been easy in an industry notorious for it's scant regard for actresses after they reach 30. You can bet that the studios would have at least insisted on the safety of a Sharon Stone or a Demi Moore.  But Tarantino, as he did when casting Travolta, stuck to his gut-instinct, and once again it proved an inspired choice.  Grier, bringing with her the memories of her 70's blackploitation movies, gives a convincingly tough, wise and sympathetic performance.Actors love to work with Tarantino because the roles he gives them will be invariably jucier than usual.  That is once again the case here, although the casting isn't quite as inspired as it was in ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"" (or ""True Romance"").  Samuel L. Jackson is reliably good - if hardly stretched - as an unscrupulous hustler who is not as smart as he thinks he is, and Bridget Fonda has fun as his conniving beach babe girlfriend.  Robert Forster jumps at the chance to play a role with depth after years in made-for-tv hell. Robert De Niro though, despite providing some amusing moments, is disappointingly wasted as Jackson's dim-witted partner.At times this feels like just another thriller, but every now and then Tarantino reminds you what all the fuss was about.  Jackson's brutal (off-screen) dispatching of Chris Tucker in the boot of a car, as the camera slowly cranes up into the sky, is masterfully conceived and a scene, which is subtly built up to, involving a teasing Fonda and a p*****-off De Niro is as unexpected and as shocking as anything Tarantino has done before.  By refusing to make a Pulp Fiction 2, Tarantino may have missed out on some easy money, but this film has enough to suggest that he will be more than just a flash in the pan.",negative,"[['Quentin Tarantino', 'the phenomenal success', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', 'writer-director', 'generation'], ['the only time', 'chair'], ['Jackie Brown', 'difficult third film', 'response', 'criticism', 'real life'], ['the backlash', 'Elmore Leonard', 'novel', 'familiar world', 'LA', 'trademark', 'comic-book', 'violence', 'pop-culture', 'ageing', 'the feeling', 'time'], ['The result', 'a slick', 'interesting', 'draggy thriller', 'the freshness', 'audaciousness', 'films.Tarantino', 'maverick', 'streak', 'though', 'trusting', 'Pam Grier', 'the entire movie'], ['The casting', 'a middle-aged black actress', 'no box-office', 'clout', 'the lead role', 'an industry', 'scant regard'], ['the safety', 'Sharon Stone', 'Demi Moore'], ['Tarantino', 'casting', 'Travolta', 'an inspired choice'], ['Grier', 'blackploitation', 'wise', 'Tarantino'], ['the case', 'the casting', 'Pulp', 'Romance'], ['Samuel L.

497,Jackie Brown,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0422058/,"Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell whether this was a conscious decision by Tarantino himself, or it's because of the source material, but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama White Mama',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promise in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given, and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the central story of this movie concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves.

498,The Devil's Advocate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1051326/,"This is one of the most intensely dark and beguiling movies I have seen. The purpose behind it is to create a moral drama about the fight between good and evil in a man, or the devil's everlasting quest to conquer man's soul. In retrospective, there are few movies I've seen that bring out such strong feelings in me. Specially the first hour. We follow a young couple, played by Reeves and Theron in her first big picture, who move to New York from the south when he is given a job as attorney in one of the biggest firms in the country. We see the change come in Kevin as he is introduced to a world of luxury and pleasure by his boss, THE DEVIL, played by old master Al Pacino.The ending brings a new, unpredictable and great twist to the story. I will not give it away. The supporting cast is pretty strong, specially Jeffrey Jones who plays a senior partner in Lucifer Pacino's firm and who first arises the suspicion in Kevin/Keanu with his mysterious behaviour, and Connie Nielsen as Cristabella, an extremely hot Italian colleague who is the very symbol of temptation. Nielsen looked even better here than in ""Gladiator"" and her performance is also more interesting. Charlize Theron displayed her range here for the first time, showing she had a great potential to become a star with her mix of ethereal beauty and acting talent. Reeves was also very good as the hotshot attorney and his looks elevated his macho hero potential. Al Pacino didn't disappoint, but his performance here counts as one of his least spectacular.This is a dark movie with elements of horror and some gore and sex thrown in for good measure. I think Taylor Hackford never did it better. He gave us something to ponder on while entertaining and scaring us at the same time.
