Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.\\nFor someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievem...   \n4  I find it somewhat odd that some people have interpreted this film as anticapitalist. It shines a very narrow light on poverty but it is all conveyed in a very surreal scenario which makes it quite difficult to emotionally engage with the situations that transpire. However, that's not the only reason.The main characters are not particularly likeable, which I'm sure defenders of the film would describe them as morally grey, given the prevailing cultural obsession with the moral ambiguity.It's...   \n\n  sentiment  \n0  negative  \n1  positive  \n2  negative  \n3  positive  \n4  negative  ",

So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like \"Batman Begins\" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be \"152 minutes of pure awesomeness.\" Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the...</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>The Dark Knight</td>\n      <td>https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478826/</td>\n      <td>Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.</td>\n      <td>positive</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Inception</td>\n      <td>https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2286063/</td>\n      <td>I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film.

Cluster 9 is one of these. It looks just like a random sampling of words.\n",
