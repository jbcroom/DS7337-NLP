    "### Assignment Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a vocabulary-based sentiment analysis of the movie reviews you used in homework 5 and homework 7, by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIn Python, load one of the sentiment vocabularies referenced in the textbook, and run the sentiment analyzer as explained in the corresponding reference. Add words to the sentiment vocabulary, if you think you need to, to better fit your particular text collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tFor each of the clusters you created in homework 7, compute the average, median, high, and low sentiment scores for each cluster. Explain whether you think this reveals anything interesting about the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tFor extra credit, analyze sentiment of chunks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Take the chunks from homework 5, and in Python, run each chunk individually through your sentiment analyzer that you used in question 1. If the chunk registers a nonneutral sentiment, save it in a tabular format (the chunk, the sentiment score).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Now sort the table twice, once to show the highest negative-sentiment-scoring chunks at the top and again to show the highest positive-sentiment-scoring chunks at the top. Examine the upper portions of both sorted lists, to identify any trends, and explain what you see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Submit all of your inputs and outputs and your code for this assignment, along with a brief written explanation of your findings. \n",

    "Looking that the top ten items from the most negative and most positive sentiments we see trends in the individual listings. For example, in the negative sentiments we see a lot of negative words such as failure, fear and anger. These terms all elicit a negative emotion and make sense. We can also see that with respect to the sentiment analysis there is a lot of negative sentiment detected for the movie series \"The Evil Dead\". Without context we could simply say reviewers dislike this movie series. However, this negative sentiments could also be due to the fact that these movies sit in the horror genre and many reviews could be positive but the descriptive words used around horror movies may unexpectedly turn the sentiment negative.\n",

    "Looking at the positive list, We see a lot of positive words such as great, fun, and magnificent. These listing of positive sentiments doesn't seem to have a lot of focus on a particular genere of movie or a particular movie. The sentiment seems to be more spread out for the positive sentiment items."
